## Introduction
This guide is an ever-evolving list of advice on errors and usage. It's based on the comments that I find myself giving to St. Edward's University students over and over. As a result, it reflects local concerns and my own biases and preferences. I hope that it's broad enough to be useful, but it can't be comprehensive (read Bryan Garner's *Modern English Usage* and the whole [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/) if you want comprehensive). 

# A

#### *affect* vs. *effect*
[Paul Brians explains the correct usage of these commonly confused words](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/affect.html).
#### *a lot*
*A lot* is an informal way of expressing a large quantity when formality and specifics don't matter (*He ate a lot of green beans yesterday. A lot of the first-down plays were short passes over the middle.*). Generally, in formal writing, *a lot* comes across as vague or imprecise. Try reworking it. Also, *alot* is always wrong.
#### *and/or*
Although some use people *and/or* as a crutch, don't use it in your own writing. In the words of the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), Rule 5.220 at 266: "Avoid this Janus-faced term. It can often be replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning. Where it seems needed . . . , try "or" . . . or both (e.g., "take a sleeping pill or a warm drink or both"). But think of other possibilities."
#### apostrophe error
The Purdue OWL [has some great advice on using apostrophes](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/).
#### *as humans*, *we as humans*
These are abstract placeholders for ideas. Can we really be other than humans or experience anything other than as humans? Rework for clarity.
#### *as such*
Bryan Garner: "Take care when using this phrase. Good usage requires employing *as such* only if you can replace it with “as [some noun just mentioned].” Never use *as such* to express causation (instead, use *thus,* *therefore,* or *so*). [Read more from Garner on this phrase](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-179-as-such/)



# B

#### *based off of*, *based around*
Logically, nothing can be "based off of/off/around" something else. Just write *based on.*
#### *begs the question* vs. *raises the question*
Begging the question is a logical fallacy of circular argument, e.g., "God created the world because the Bible says so." Using *beg the question* to mean *raise the question* is certain to annoy traditionalists (on this, I am a traditionalist) because they see it as imprecise. 
#### *being that*
Never write *being that* to mean *because.* Just write *because.*
#### Britishisms
Avoid Britishisms (e.g., *colour, humour, whilst, centre, spilt*) in American contexts. 
#### buried verb
A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a *–tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance*, or *–ity* ending added (e.g., *realization* instead of *realize*). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

#### capitalization
The [Purdue OWL explains the rules for using capital letters](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/592/1/).
#### cliche
A cliche can be any overused metaphor, word, or phrase that you've heard or read so many times that any clarity or vividness it might once have had is gone. Examples: *tried and true, student-centered learning, at the end of the day, straight and narrow, paradigm shift, think outside the box, everyone is entitled to their own opinion*, etc. Try to avoid cliches in your own writing. Here is a [website listing common cliches](http://clichesite.com/alpha_list.asp?which=lett+1). 


#### comma after introductory element
Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: **Before I could kill Count Dracula,** I had to find a wooden stake. Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. [The Purdue OWL explains more here](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/03/).
#### comma splice
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences.You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from a textbook](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/everyday_writer3e/20errors/8.html) for help. 

# D

#### decades
Do not use an apostrophe before the *s* in a decade. Incorrect: *1970's*; Correct: *1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *the '60s*
#### dropped quote
Always integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. A “dropped quote” is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** The quote is simply plunked into the writing. 

Possible fix: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in as if it stops the conversation of your paper. 
#### *dynamic*
*Dynamic* as an adjective (*dynamic content*) and as a noun (*the family dynamic*) is often a vague buzzword. Can you reword to clarify?


# E

#### existential filler
A *There is...* or *there are* sentence-opener is usually mere filler that can be cut. Example: *There are many people who believe that Sasquatch exists.* Rework to *Many people believe that Sasquatch exists.* 

# F

#### *female* as noun
If you mean a human being, use *girl* or *woman*--whichever is age-appropriate. Only when writing scientifically or about animals should you use *female* as a noun, e.g., *These lab rats are the males; these are the females.* 
#### fragment (sentence fragment)
Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. *Like this. Really*. Usually, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/). 
#### fused (aka run-on) sentence
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a fused/run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. [Advice from the Center for Writing Studies, UIUC](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/fusedsentences/).


# G

#### GSAs--Giant Squishy Abstractions
GSAs (*technology, human nature, society, the youth of today, this modern age*, etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

#### hyphenating phrasal adjectives
Phrasal adjective (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

#### *impactful*
As usage expert Paul Brians argues, "Many people in business and education like to speak of things that have an impact as being 'impactful,' but this term does not appear in most dictionaries and is not well thought of by traditionalists. Use 'influential' or 'effective' instead." *Impactful* may be in dictionaries by now, but some usage experts (and I) consider it yet another awful corporate buzzword (e.g., *Let's reach out for some impactful metrics in our mobile, disruptive, next-gen solutions brainstorming.*). Take Brians' suggestions re: *influential* or *effective.*
#### *In conclusion, *In summary*
Never end a paper or other project with *In conclusion* or *In summary* because you'll sound like a fifth-grader writing a book report. Harvard's Writing Center has some [good advice](http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions), as does the [Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/conclusions/)
#### *incredibly*
Students love to write *incredibly* for some reason--I had a paper recently that had seven instances of *incredibly* in four pages. *Incredibly* is imprecise and should usually be changed or cut. It's usually a sign of a phrase that can be replaced by a well-chosen adjective. 
#### indirect quote
An "indirect quote" is a source quoted in another source. For example, suppose Source A quotes and cites Source B, but you don't have Source B yourself. In MLA style use *qtd. in* to indicate the source you actually used. For example: Sherman contends that "Writing centers across the country have struggled with the problem of securing adequate resources" (qtd. in Jefferson 493). That construction signals that you are using the quotation and citation to Sherman from p. 493 of Jefferson, but you are not using the original Sherman source itself. NB: Except for use of textbook-type materials, a good researcher will try to find the original source, rather than relying on indirect quotes. In any case, you have to accurately attribute quotes to their actual sources. 
#### *in order to*,*in order for*
*In order to* and *in order for* can usually be cut to *to* or *for* without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
#### *issue* vs. *problem*
If you mean *problem*, you should just write *problem*. Many people use *issue* as a synonym, but it's imprecise. Rework.  
#### *its* vs. *it's*: 
*Its* is the possessive of *it*: The monkey played with its tail. *It's* is a contraction for *it is*: It's important to know how to cook.

# L 

#### *less* vs. *fewer*

See [this advice from Bryan Garner:](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-144-less-vs-fewer/]) "Use *fewer* when referring to individual or countable things (*fewer than ten chairs*, *fewer questions asked by judges*). Use *less* when referring to volume, quantity, or degree (*less influence on the jurors*), mass or bulk nouns (*less water in the glass*), or units of measure or time (*less than three ounces,* *less than five months*). There is one exception: use *less* when count nouns are really being used as amounts instead of individual increments (he has *less* than one million dollars*, *e have less than two minutes of rebuttal time*)."

#### *Look at/looking at*
These are vague phrases. If you mean something like *analyze* or *examine*, use forms of those verbs.

# P

#### Paramedic Method
Richard Lanham's famous Paramedic Method for revising sentences helps you to rework vague, wordy, bureaucratic-sounding prose. [The Purdue OWL explains this easy, effective method](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/635/01/) for tightening sentences and reworking wooly ideas. 
#### passive voice
You should have a strong bias favoring active voice (*Lincoln delivered the speech*) over passive voice (*The speech was delivered by Lincoln*), unless you have a specific reason for using passive voice. Passive voice is not **wrong**; it’s just (usually) weaker. For more details, see [this handout from our Writing Center](https://sites.stedwards.edu/writing/files/2015/09/St.-Edwards-Univ-Writing-Center-Handout-on-Passive-Voice-19nzb1n.pdf). 
#### people vs entities: pronouns
Is it *it/its* or *they/theirs* when referring to groups of people, companies, countries? See [this advice](www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/people-versus-entities)

# R

#### *reach out to*
*Reach out to* is voguish bizspeak for *contact, call, write*, or some other specific verb. *Reach out to* is becoming common usage, but many readers find it grating, vague, and wordy. A specific single verb is probably best.
#### *relatable*
*Relatable* is a vague word that many readers, including me, dislike. When students use *relatable*, they usually mean to express something about identification, empathy, or appealing to an audience. Can you reword to be clearer? 
####  *relate to*
That X "relates to" Y explains almost nothing. Here is an exaggerated illustration: I "relate to" the planet Neptune because we are in the same solar system. So what? Can you reword to be clearer? What is the exact relationship between X and Y?

# S

#### *said* [for *those* or *that*]
If you mean *that* or *those*, write *that* or *those.* *Said* sounds like a legalese-loving attorney, not like a human being communicating something interesting.
#### semicolons in series
If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. 
#### serial comma aka "Oxford comma"
I favor the serial comma (aka “Oxford comma") because it enhances clarity. [Definition and examples](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma)

# T

#### *that* vs. *which*
In American usage, favor *that* over  *which,* unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use *which* plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use *that* to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky. EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip." Bryan Garner offers [more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-that-1/).
#### *that*, wrongly suppressed
Bryan Garner: "In formal writing *that* is often ill-advisedly omitted, creating a miscue or an ambiguity, even if only momentarily. In particular, the conjunction that should usually be retained to introduce clauses following verbs such as *acknowledge, ask, believe, claim, doubt, hold, indicate, say*, and *suggest*. [More here on the "wrongly suppressed *that*":](http://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-127-wrongly-suppressed-that/)
#### TV titles
Italicize the titles of TV programs: *The Wire,* *Monday Night Football*. Use quotation marks for titles of individual episodes: The “Amok Time” episode of *Star Trek*

# V

#### Verbs, precise
Forms of: *says, writes, states, thinks*, and *feels* are usually less vivid or precise than other verbs you can choose. Try to choose a verb that most accurately characterizes the action you are trying to show. Here is a [list of precise verbs](https://studentsuccess.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Annotation%20Verbs.pdf) that you will find useful in replacing weak verbs.
#### very
*Very* with an adjective usually signals a weak construction that should be tightened with more precise word choice. Examples: *very smart* (try *brilliant)*, *very important* (try *essential*), or *very old* (try *ancient*).

# W

#### *who, whom*
“Like *whom*, the pronoun *him* ends with *m*. When you're trying to decide whether to use *who* or *whom*, ask yourself if the answer to the question could be *he* or *him*. That's the trick: if you can answer the question being asked with *him*, use *whom*, and it's easy to remember because they both end with *m*.” [See more](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/who-versus-whom)
