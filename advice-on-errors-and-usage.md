## Introduction
This guide is an ever-evolving list of advice on errors and usage. It's based on the comments that I find myself giving to St. Edward's University students over and over. As a result, it reflects local concerns and my own biases and preferences. I hope that it's broad enough to be useful, but it can't be comprehensive (read Bryan Garner's *Modern English Usage* and the whole [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/) if you want comprehensive). 

# A

#### *is/was able to*
When describing something someone else did, wrote, or said, students often write that the other person *is/was able to* do, write, or say such and such. If someone actually did something, then it follows that they must have been able to do that thing. The problem is one of emphasis: is the emphasis on the thing that they did, or on their ability to do it? Compare: *Richard Sherman was able to intercept Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.// Richard Sherman intercepted Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.* Where do you want the emphasis? If some precondition is or was necessary to the action, and you want to bring all that out in your sentence, *is/was able to* can be okay: *By watching the receiver's eyes, Richard Sherman was able to time his jump just right to intercept Tom Brady's pass.* 
#### *affect* vs. *effect*
[Paul Brians explains the correct usage of these commonly confused words](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/affect.html).
#### *aforementioned*
Assuming that the reference to something that came before is clear (is it?), this stuffy, legalese-sounding word can be replaced with some other pointing word such as *these, that,* or *those.* Rather than using *aforementioned,* which creates tone problems, rewrite for clarity.
#### *a lot*
*A lot* is an informal way of expressing a large quantity when formality and specifics don't matter (*He ate a lot of green beans yesterday. A lot of the first-down plays were short passes over the middle.*) Generally, in formal writing, *a lot* comes across as vague or imprecise. Try reworking it. Also, *alot* is always wrong.
#### *and/or*
Although some use people *and/or* as a crutch, don't use it in your own writing. In the words of the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), Rule 5.220 at 266: "Avoid this Janus-faced term. It can often be replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning. Where it seems needed . . . , try "or" . . . or both (e.g., "take a sleeping pill or a warm drink or both"). But think of other possibilities."
#### apostrophe error
The Purdue OWL [has some great advice on using apostrophes](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/).
#### *as humans*, *we as humans*, *as people*
These are abstract placeholders for ideas. Can we really be other than humans or experience anything other than as humans or people? Rework for clarity.
#### *as such*
Bryan Garner: "Take care when using this phrase. Good usage requires employing *as such* only if you can replace it with “as [some noun just mentioned].” Never use *as such* to express causation (instead, use *thus,* *therefore,* or *so*). [Read more from Garner on this phrase](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-179-as-such/)
#### *at this time* / *at this point in time*
These phrases say nothing more than *now,* so you should probably just use *now.*



# B

#### *based off of*, *based around*
Logically, nothing can be "based off of/off/around" something else. Just write *based on.*
#### *begs the question* vs. *raises the question*
Begging the question is a logical fallacy of circular argument, e.g., "God created the world because the Bible says so." Using *beg the question* to mean *raise the question* is certain to annoy traditionalists (on this, I am a traditionalist) because they see it as imprecise. 
#### *being that*
Never write *being that* to mean *because.* Just write *because.*
#### Britishisms
Avoid Britishisms (e.g., *colour, humour, whilst, centre, spilt*) in American contexts. 
#### buried verb
A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a *–tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance*, or *–ity* ending added (e.g., *realization* instead of *realize*). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

#### capitalization, general
The [Purdue OWL explains the rules for using capital letters](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/592/1/). NB: When referring to someone by title, capitalize the title if it precedes their name: *President Lincoln.* Don't capitalize titles that refer generically to the idea of the title: *College presidents need to listen to faculty.* Don't capitalize titles that come after the name: *Ted Cruz is a senator who has not always gotten along with his own party.* But: *Senator Cruz spoke at the luncheon.* 
#### capitalization, *armed forces*
"Capitalize only as a proper name (*Armed Forces Day*), not as a noun (*the armed forces*) or adjective (*an armed-forces member*). Lower case unless part of a title or when preceded by *U.S.*, as in *U.S. Armed Forces*." Source: [US Navy Style Guide](http://www.navy.mil/tools/view_styleguide_all.asp).
#### capitalization of *Black/black, White/white*, etc.
This is a fraught issue and I have read well-reasoned arguments for and against capitalization. The *Columbia Journalism Review* offers [a good discussion](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/language_corner_1.php) of the issues and choices involved. 
#### classic style
Classic style, a term coined by Francis Noel-Thomas and Mark Turner, describes a middle style between informal and formal. It aims for clarity and economy of expression. The goal is to make writing sound like educated speech (not stuffy speech, not highfalutin speech) and to create a confident, thoughtful persona through stylistic choices. [Much more on classic style, including caveats](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/), can be found on my website. I also encourage you to [read more about it from Thomas and Turner themselves](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/).
#### cliche
A cliche can be any overused metaphor, word, or phrase that you've heard or read so many times that any clarity or vividness it might once have had is gone. Examples: *tried and true, easier said than done, student-centered learning, at the end of the day, straight and narrow, paradigm shift, think outside the box, everyone is entitled to their own opinion*, etc. Try to avoid cliches in your own writing. Here is a [website listing common cliches](http://clichesite.com/alpha_list.asp?which=lett+1). 
#### comma after introductory element
Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: *Before I could kill Count Dracula, I had to find a wooden stake.* Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. [The Purdue OWL explains more here](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/03/).
#### comma splice
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences. You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from a textbook](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/everyday_writer3e/20errors/8.html) for help. 
#### conclusions
Don't begin a conclusion to an essay by writing "In conclusion," "In summary," or some such. As the Harvard Writing Center explains: "These phrases can be useful--even welcome--in oral presentations. But readers can see, by the tell-tale compression of the pages, when an essay is about to end. You'll irritate your audience if you belabor the obvious."

# D

#### decades
Do not use an apostrophe before the *s* in a decade. Incorrect: *1970's*; Correct: *1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *the '60s*
#### *detract* vs. *deter*
As Bryan Garner explains, *detract* can mean *to divert,* but it's much more commonly used to mean *to take something away from* (*The flies buzzing around the room detracted from my enjoyment of the tasting menu at Chez Louis*). Garner explains that the less-common use of *detract* is much better expressed as *distract*: *Some claim that Trump hopes that his tweets will ~~detract~~ distract attention from his scandals*. Sometimes, students write *detract* when they mean *deter*: *This policy change could ~~detract~~ deter students from signing up for those classes.*
#### dropped quote
Always integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. A “dropped quote” is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** The quote is simply plunked into the writing. 

Possible fix: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in as if it stops the conversation of your paper. 
#### *due to the fact that*
*Due to the fact that* can always be switched to a simple *because*. 
#### *dynamic*
*Dynamic* as an adjective (*dynamic content*) and as a noun (*the family dynamic*) is often a vague buzzword. Can you reword to clarify?


# E
#### editorial *we*/royal *we*
As Bryan Garner puts it, "It is certainly eccentric to see a solo writer using *we* and *our* when no one else is involved." In the same vein, but with more humor, Mark Twain argues: "Only kings, presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial 'we.'" Rework.

#### existential filler
A *There is...* or *There are...* sentence-opener is usually mere filler that can be cut. Example: *There are many people who believe that Sasquatch exists.* Rework to *Many people believe that Sasquatch exists.* 

# F

#### *female* as noun
If you mean a human being, use *girl* or *woman*--whichever is age-appropriate. Only when writing scientifically or about animals should you use *female* as a noun, e.g., *These lab rats are the males; these are the females.* 
#### fragment (sentence fragment)
Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. *Like this. Really*. Usually, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/). 
#### fused (aka run-on) sentence
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a fused/run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. [Advice on fused sentences from the Center for Writing Studies, UIUC](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/fusedsentences/).


# G

#### GSAs--Giant Squishy Abstractions
GSAs (*technology, human nature, today's society, the youth of today, this modern age*, etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

#### hyphenating phrasal adjectives
Phrasal adjectives (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

#### *impactful*
As usage expert Paul Brians argues, "Many people in business and education like to speak of things that have an impact as being 'impactful,' but this term does not appear in most dictionaries and is not well thought of by traditionalists. Use 'influential' or 'effective' instead." *Impactful* may be in dictionaries by now, but some usage experts (and I) consider it yet another awful corporate buzzword (e.g., *Let's reach out for some impactful metrics in our mobile, disruptive, next-gen solutions brainstorming.*). Take Brians' suggestions re: *influential* or *effective.*
#### *In conclusion*, *In summary*
Never end a paper or other project with *In conclusion* or *In summary* because you'll sound like a fifth-grader writing a book report. Harvard's Writing Center has some [good advice](http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions), as does the [Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/conclusions/)
#### *incredible,* *incredibly*
For some reason, students seem to love to write *incredible* and *incredibly.* I had a paper recently that had seven instances of *incredibly* in four pages. These words are hyperbolic, imprecise, and should usually be replaced. Much like the overused word *very,* *incredibly* usually signals a phrase that can be cut and then replaced by a single well-chosen adjective. 
#### indirect quote
An "indirect quote" is a source quoted in another source. For example, suppose Source A quotes and cites Source B, but you don't have Source B yourself. In MLA style use *qtd. in* to indicate the source you actually used. For example: Sherman contends that "Writing centers across the country have struggled with the problem of securing adequate resources" (qtd. in Jefferson 493). That construction signals that you are using the quotation and citation to Sherman from p. 493 of Jefferson, but you are not using the original Sherman source itself. NB: Except for use of textbook-type materials, a good researcher will try to find the original source, rather than relying on indirect quotes. In any case, you have to accurately attribute quotes to their actual sources. 
#### *infamous*
Be sure that you really mean *infamous,* which has negative connotations. Often, students write *infamous* when they mean *famous*. Merriam-Webster Dictionaries [explains the two words' meaning](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/infamous-vs-famous).
#### *in order to*, *in order for*
*In order to* and *in order for* can usually be cut to *to* or *for* without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
#### *issue* vs. *problem*
If you mean *problem*, you should just write *problem*. Many people use *issue* as a synonym, but it's imprecise. Rework.  
#### *its* vs. *it's*: 
*Its* is the possessive of *it*: *The monkey played with its tail*. *It's* is a contraction for *it is*: *It's important to know how to cook.*

# L 

#### *less* vs. *fewer*

See [this advice from Bryan Garner:](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-144-less-vs-fewer/]) "Use *fewer* when referring to individual or countable things (*fewer than ten chairs*, *fewer questions asked by judges*). Use *less* when referring to volume, quantity, or degree (*less influence on the jurors*), mass or bulk nouns (*less water in the glass*), or units of measure or time (*less than three ounces,* *less than five months*). There is one exception: use *less* when count nouns are really being used as amounts instead of individual increments (he has *less* than one million dollars*, *We have less than two minutes of rebuttal time*)."
#### *like* vs. *such as*
Strict usage sticklers insist that *like* (in this sense) means "similar to," while *such as* introduces examples. Compare: *I like restaurants like La Casa Bonita* (restaurants similar to Casa Bonita) vs. *I like restaurants such as Casa Bonita* (restaurants in general, of which Casa Bonita is an example). This so-called rule may never have been a rule in the first place, but some readers insist upon it. In general, it might be a good idea to ask whether you mean to focus on the class of things (drawing similarities) or on examples and choose accordingly. I have read that academic writing favors *such as* because it often uses examples, but I have not seen the support for that position myself. A [history and synopsis of this usage question](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/02/like-such-as.html) can be found at the Grammarphobia blog. 
#### *Look at/looking at*/*talk about*
These phrases as synonyms for *analyze* or *examine* are okay in informal speech and informal writing, but you're probably better off being precise and just writing *analyze,* *examine,* or some such in most of your expository writing.

# M
#### *Meaning that*
If you begin a sentence *Meaning that....*, you are probably trying to express something like *In other words,...* *Meaning that....* usually indicates a sentence fragment.
#### *medium/media*
*Media* as a mass noun is perfectly okay: *The media are investigating Anthony Weiner's tweets.* When referring to a single medium, such as TV, radio, etc., use *medium.* When referring to more than one medium, use *media,* never *mediums*: *Shep Gordon has promoted a variety of artists in several media: live performance, television, films, and books.* *Mediums* is the plural of *medium,* i.e., a person who claims to be in contact with the spirit world: *Madame Xsaya is a medium who charges $500 for a seance* or sizes of things: *Old Navy was sold out of large T-shirts--I could only find mediums.* 

# N
#### names
When referring to someone by name, use first name and last name the first time you mention them (*Kenneth Burke*), then last name from that point forward (*Later, Burke adds that....*). You don't need to keep repeating their first and last names together. If you have two people with the same last name, you'll have to bend this rule so as to keep clear who you mean. 

Watch out when you use first names--generally, most analytical or expository writing uses last names. Using someone's first name often creates a tone problem, a problem that is magnified if you refer to men as *Mr. So and So*, but revert to first names when referring to women (odd tone becomes sexist tone).

# P

#### Paramedic Method
Richard Lanham's famous Paramedic Method for revising sentences helps you to rework vague, wordy, bureaucratic-sounding prose. [The Purdue OWL explains this easy, effective method](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/635/01/) for tightening sentences and reworking wooly ideas. The Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has [an excellent handout](http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_wordyphrases.html) on tightening wordy phrases.
#### passive voice
You should have a strong bias favoring active voice (*Lincoln delivered the speech*) over passive voice (*The speech was delivered by Lincoln*), unless you have a specific reason for using passive voice. Passive voice is not **wrong**; it’s just (usually) weaker. For more details, see [this handout from our Writing Center](https://sites.stedwards.edu/writing/files/2015/09/St.-Edwards-Univ-Writing-Center-Handout-on-Passive-Voice-19nzb1n.pdf). 
#### people vs entities: pronouns
Is it *it/its* or *they/theirs* when referring to groups of people, companies, countries? See [this advice](www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/people-versus-entities)
#### *problematic*
*Problematic* is often used to flag a statement, an idea, or a representation as wrong, pernicious, or troubling in some way, at least from the perspective of the person labeling it *problematic.* There's nothing inherently wrong with *problematic,* except it has been used so often and in so many contexts (ranging from the truly troubling to the mildly annoying or even frivolous) that it is in danger of devolving into a mere cliche. Bryan Garner has no problem with it, calling it "standard" usage (Source: *Garner's Modern English Usage*, 4th ed.). But it has become so common and so readily deployed that--at least in my opinion--it is in danger of becoming a placeholder for an argument rather than a precise term that enables argument. So: use with caution and consider rewording for precision. 

# Q

#### quotation marks, single vs. double
In American usage, double quotation marks start a quotation and single quotation marks are for material quoted inside that quote: *Jones agrees with this point, adding that "Whenever he had a few too many Red Bulls, I often heard Dr. Doom claim that he was 'sure to vanquish that pesky Spider-Man'" (67).* Use double quotations for those ironic, sarcastic quotation marks that distance you from the term or material within the quotation marks: *This "innovation" that the consultant touted is not worth the effort.* These are sometimes called *shudder quotes* and have the effect of adding "so-called": *This [so-called] "innovation."* Use shudder quotes sparingly--a writer who leans too heavily on them comes off as snarky, hectoring, or tedious. 
#### quotation marks with other punctuation 
See [this resource on punctuation and quotation marks](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/01/) by the Purdue OWL. Students often mistakenly place periods and commas outside of quotation marks when they should be inside.

# R

#### *reach out to*
*Reach out to* is voguish bizspeak for *contact, call, write*, or some other specific verb. *Reach out to* is becoming common usage, but many readers find it grating, vague, and wordy. A specific single verb is probably best.
#### *relatable*
*Relatable* is a vague word that many readers, including me, dislike. When students use *relatable*, they usually mean to express something about identification, empathy, or appealing to an audience. Can you reword to be clearer? 
####  *relate to*
That X "relates to" Y explains almost nothing. Here is an exaggerated illustration: I "relate to" the planet Neptune because we are in the same solar system. So what? Can you reword to be clearer? What is the exact relationship between X and Y?

# S

#### *said* [for *those* or *that*]
If you mean *that* or *those*, write *that* or *those.* *Said* sounds like a legalese-loving attorney, not like a human being communicating something interesting.
#### semicolons in series
If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. 
#### serial comma aka "Oxford comma"
I favor the serial comma (aka “Oxford comma") because it enhances clarity. [Definition and examples](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma)
#### sexist language
[Garner offers strategies](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-3/) for reworking sentences to avoid a generic masculine pronoun and for [handling words that traditionally end in -man](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-5/) (e.g., *fireman* becomes *firefighter*). 


# T

#### *that* vs. *which*
In American usage, favor *that* over  *which,* unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use *which* plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use *that* to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky.* EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip."* Bryan Garner offers [more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-that-1/).
#### *that*, wrongly suppressed
Bryan Garner: "In formal writing *that* is often ill-advisedly omitted, creating a miscue or an ambiguity, even if only momentarily. In particular, the conjunction that should usually be retained to introduce clauses following verbs such as *acknowledge, ask, believe, claim, doubt, hold, indicate, say*, and *suggest*. [More here on the "wrongly suppressed *that*](http://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-127-wrongly-suppressed-that/).
#### *they,* singular 
[Bryan Garner has covered this masterfully](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-4/). I accept the singular *they* because it has a long history of use, it solves the English language's common-sex singular personal pronoun glitch, and it avoids sexism. The singular *they* can also be used to refer to people who don't identify as male or female. Much more on that [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34901704).
#### titles, periodicals
Titles of periodicals (newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals) should be italicized: *New York Times,* the *Times* article, *Rhetoric Review,* *National Geographic,* *Lucky Peach.* 
#### titles, films
In MLA style, film titles are italicized: *The Godfather*, *Shrek*, *Sharknado*. Other styles, such as the *New York Times* style sheet, use double quotation marks: "The Godfather," "Shrek," "Sharknado."
#### titles, music
In MLA style, song titles are set off with quotation marks: "Welcome to the Terrordome," "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Album titles are italicized: *Houses of the Holy,* *Q: Are We Not Men? A: We are Devo!*
#### titles, TV shows
Italicize the titles of TV programs: *The Wire,* *Monday Night Football*. Use quotation marks for titles of individual episodes: The “Amok Time” episode of *Star Trek*
#### *try and*
*Try and* is an accepted informal way of expressing *try to.* If you use *try and,* ask yourself if the overall genre, purpose, tone, and style of the document is formal or informal. Consider changing *try and* to *try to.* 

# U
#### *use* vs *utilize*
Some people [claim that there is a meaningful distinction between these words](http://throwgrammarfromthetrain.blogspot.com/2013/12/using-utilize-what-mavens-say.html), but I am not convinced. In my view, *utilize* is always inferior to *use* because it is bureucratic-sounding, elliptical, and unnecessarily burdensome.

# V

#### Verbs, precise
Forms of: *says, writes, states, thinks*, and *feels* are usually less vivid or precise than other verbs you can choose. Try to choose a verb that most accurately characterizes the action you are trying to show. Here is a [list of precise verbs](https://studentsuccess.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Annotation%20Verbs.pdf) that you will find useful in replacing weak verbs.
#### very
*Very* followed by an adjective usually signals a weak construction that should be tightened with more precise word choice. Examples: *very smart* (try *brilliant)*, *very important* (try *essential*), or *very old* (try *ancient*).
#### very unique
*Very unique* is a phrase that should be used with caution in edited writing. [The folks at Merriam-Webster explain why](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/very-unique-and-absolute-adjectives) (scroll to bottom of page).

# W
#### *whether or not*
Bryan Garner reminds us that "Despite the superstition to the contrary, the words *or not* are usually superfluous, sinces *whether* implies *or not.*" But, he adds, "*or not* is necessary when *whether or not* means 'regarless of whether' [e.g.,] *the meeting will go on whether or not it rains*." More than half of the student uses of *whether* that I've seen are of the first kind, making *or not* superfluous. 
#### *who, whom*
Mignon Fogarty: “Like *whom*, the pronoun *him* ends with *m*. When you're trying to decide whether to use *who* or *whom*, ask yourself if the answer to the question could be *he* or *him*. That's the trick: if you can answer the question being asked with *him*, use *whom*, and it's easy to remember because they both end with *m*.” [See more](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/who-versus-whom).
#### *who vs. that* 
The [Purdue OWL summarizes the current thinking on *who* vs. *that*](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/645/01/): "When referring to people, both *that* and *who* can be used in informal language. *That* may be used to refer to the characteristics or abilities of an individual or a group of people: *He is the kind of person that/who will never let you down.*[...] However, when speaking about a particular person in formal language, *who* is preferred: *The old lady who lives next door is a teacher.*" In my opinion, using *who* for people preserves something special about being a person, if indeed there is something special about being a person--certainly, many people still think so. *That* sounds a bit like you're referring to an object, so it's frowned upon slightly in some quarters. Technically, though, *that* is correct and has a long history of usage. 
#### *would be* as odd substitute for *is*
Writers often use *would be* as an odd substitute for forms of the verb *to be,* typically for *is.* Compare: *The best golfer on the tour would be Jordan Spieth.* Unless you are expressing something about the future, you don't need *would be* when you could just write *is* or *was*: *The best golfer on the tour is Jordan Spieth.*
