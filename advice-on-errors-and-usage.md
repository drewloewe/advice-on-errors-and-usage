## Introduction
This guide is an ever-evolving list of advice--mostly on errors and usage, but also on other writing topics. It's based on the comments that I find myself giving to St. Edward's University students over and over. As a result, it reflects local concerns and my own biases and preferences. I hope that it's broad enough to be useful, but it can't be comprehensive. Read Bryan Garner's *Modern English Usage* and the whole [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/) if you want comprehensive. In particular, Garner's book is an outstanding small investment (<$50) that any serious writer should consider making.

NB: This guide generally assumes MLA citation style. MLA style is certainly not the only (or best) citation style, but it is widely used in humanities courses.

# A

#### *is/was able to*
When describing something someone else did, wrote, or said, students often write that the other person *is/was able to* do, write, or say such and such. If someone actually did something, then it follows that they must have been able to do that thing. The problem is one of emphasis: is the emphasis on the thing that they did, or on their ability to do it? Compare: *Richard Sherman was able to intercept Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.// Richard Sherman intercepted Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.* Where do you want the emphasis? If some precondition is or was necessary to the action, and you want to bring all that out in your sentence, *is/was able to* can be okay: *By watching the receiver's eyes, Richard Sherman was able to time his jump just right to intercept Tom Brady's pass.* But unless you want to emphasize the precondition, *is/was able to* risks being deadwood.
#### *aid* vs. *aide*
*Aid* as a verb means to help or assist; *aid* as a noun means some sort of assistance, e.g., *financial aid.* *Aide* means a staff member that you supervise or direct, e.g., *Wary of causing offense, the President brought his aide for protocol to the state dinner with the Prime Minister of Freedonia.* 
#### *affect* vs. *effect*
[Paul Brians explains the correct usage of these commonly confused words](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/affect.html).
#### *aforementioned*
Assuming that the reference to something that came before is clear (is it?), this stuffy, highfalutin, legalese-sounding word can be replaced with some other pointing word such as *these, that,* or *those.* Rather than using *aforementioned,* which creates tone problems, rewrite.
#### *allot*, *a lot*, *alot*
*Allot* is a verb meaning to share or apportion something, e.g., *The prosecution and defense teams were allotted one hour each*. *A lot* is an informal way of expressing a large quantity when formality and specifics don't matter (*He ate a lot of green beans yesterday. A lot of the first-down plays were short passes over the middle.*) *Allot* is not a synonym for *a lot* and *a lot* should be tightened up in polished expository prose anyway since it's too imprecise. *Alot* is an incorrect way of writing *a lot.*
#### *alright* vs *all right*
*Alright* is not standard usage and is likely to be seen as a blunder by some audiences. In informal contexts and genres, nobody might care if you write *alright.* But in college and workplace writing, stick to *all right* as a two-word phrase and you'll be, well,... *all right.* 
#### *among* vs *amongst*
In US English (and assuming expository writing), there is no reason to write the stuffy and old-fashioned-sounding *amongst.* Just write *among.* 
#### *analyzation*
This is arguably a word (so say some sources), though Garner calls it "pseudo-learned," a "nonword," and a "needless variant." In anyone's hands, even if it's a word, it just means "analysis." So rewrite it.
#### *and/or*
Although some writers use *and/or*, don't use it in your own writing. In the words of the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), Rule 5.220 at 266: "Avoid this [Janus-faced](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Janus-faced) term. It can often be replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning. Where it seems needed . . . , try "or" . . . or both (e.g., "take a sleeping pill or a warm drink or both"). But think of other possibilities." *And/or* is a misunderstanding waiting to happen. 
#### APA, multiple uses of single source in one paragraph
How do you handle multiple uses of a single source in a paragraph? You **can't** just save up one citation for the end of the paragraph and hope that your reader knows that the citation means "all that stuff in this paragraph came from this source." But APA style doesn't oblige you to keep putting the same citation after multiple sentences drawing from the same source in the same paragraph. So what to do? See [this advice](https://rasmussen.libanswers.com/faq/32328) from Rasmussen College Library and Learning Services (the three "good" examples).
#### apostrophe error
The Purdue OWL [has some great advice on using apostrophes](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/apostrophe_introduction.html), as does [The Punctuation Guide website](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/apostrophe.html). In particular, watch out for [the dreaded "grocer's apostrophe,"](http://walkinthewords.blogspot.com/2009/05/grocers-apostrophe.html) a common error.
#### appositive punctutation error
The Purdue OWL [explains what an appositive is and how to punctuate one](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/596/01/)
#### article errors
Articles (*a, an, the*) often confuse English language learners because such learners' languages may not use articles at all, but English uses them extensively. [The Purdue OWL has some good advice](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/using_articles.html).
#### *as humans*, *we as humans*, *as people*
These phrases usually come across as wooly, abstract clutter. Rework for clarity or simply cut. Consider why *as humans* is in the sentence in the first place. Try substituting it with other terms: *we as basketballs, we as fish* to see the oddness of this phrase. 
#### *as per*, *per* as substitute for *as per*
This phrase is mere jargon and should be reworked. [Prof. Paul Brians has some good advice](https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/05/17/as-per/) for fixing it. Figure out what you are trying to express (it will have something to do with specifications, orders, some stipulated content, directions, etc.) and replace *as per* with a more direct construction. *Per* by itself in this context is just as weak, too.
#### *as such*
Bryan Garner: "Take care when using this phrase. Good usage requires employing *as such* only if you can replace it with “as [some noun just mentioned].” Never use *as such* to express causation (instead, use *thus,* *therefore,* or *so*). [Read more from Garner on this phrase](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-179-as-such/).
#### *at this time* or *at this point in time*
These phrases say nothing more than *now,* so consider just using *now.*



# B

#### *basis* v. *bases*
These words are often confused. *Basis* (bay-siss) has several meanings, which [Merriam Webster explains here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/basis). *Bases* (bay-sees) is the plural of *basis*. Do you mean singular or plural? Double-check.
#### *based off*, *based off of*, *based around*
Logically, nothing can be "based off of/off/around" something else. Just write *based on.*
#### *begs the question* vs. *raises the question*
Begging the question is a logical fallacy of circular argument, e.g., "God created the world because the Bible says so." Using *beg the question* to mean *raise the question* is imprecise. If you mean *raise the question*, write that. 
#### *being that*
Never write *being that* to mean *because.* Just write *because.*
#### *bias* v. *biased*
*Bias* is a noun; *biased* is an adjective. Sometimes, writers write *bias* when they really mean *biased*, e.g., "The study's conclusion was unacceptably bias (should read: *biased*) because it excluded the control group." [Paul Brians explains the difference more here.](https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/05/19/bias-biased/)
#### *blatant, blatantly*
As Bryan Garner explains, "What is blatant stands out glaringly or repungnantly." *Blatant* has a pejorative connotation, e.g., *A blatant lie.* Often, students write *blatant* when they mean something like *vivid,* *emphatic,* or another non-pejorative adjective describing something that stands out. Do you intend a pejorative characterization?
#### Britishisms and UK-influenced spellings
While they are certainly not "errors," you should avoid Britishisms (e.g., *whilst, maths, on holiday, in hospital*, *at the weekend*) and UK-influenced spellings (e.g., *colour, humour, behaviour, programme, judgement, kerb, centre*) in US writing contexts. 
#### *broadcasted*
The past tense of *broadcast is *broadcast,* not *broadcasted.* *Broadcasted* seems logical, but its usage in quality print sources is far outweighed by *broadcast.* So, *The show was broadcast on March 7, 1989* is correct. 
#### buried verb
A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a *–tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance*, or *–ity* ending added (e.g., *realization* instead of *realize*). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

#### capitalization, general
The [Purdue OWL explains the rules for using capital letters](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.html). NB: When referring to someone by title, capitalize the title if it precedes their name: *President Lincoln.* Don't capitalize titles that refer generically to the idea of the title: *College presidents need to listen to faculty.* Don't capitalize titles that come after the name: *Ted Cruz is a senator who has not always gotten along with his own party.* But: *Senator Cruz spoke at the luncheon.* 
#### capitalization, *armed forces*
"Capitalize only as a proper name (*Armed Forces Day*), not as a noun (*the armed forces*) or adjective (*an armed-forces member*). Lower case unless part of a title or when preceded by *U.S.*, as in *U.S. Armed Forces*." Source: [US Navy Style Guide](http://www.navy.mil/tools/view_styleguide_all.asp).
#### *case-by-case*
Bryan Garner, in his *Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage,* explains that this phrase needs to be hyphenated when appearing before the noun it modifies, but not hyphenated when appearing after it. So: *on a case-by-case basis:; *the court developed this doctrine case by case.*
#### *Catholic, catholic*
Capitalize *Catholic* when it has anything to do with the Catholic Church, (e.g., *St. Edward's is a Catholic university.*) The word *catholic* can be an adjective, lower-cased, connoting "universal," "broad-minded," "wide-ranging," and the like. 
#### *cite* vs *site* vs. *sight*
These words sound the same, but differ in meaning. In writing, to *cite* something is to refer to something and show a source for it, such as citing an article that you used in writing a paper or a lawyer citing a statute in their legal argument. *Site* means location, e.g., a construction site (physical location) or a social media site (online location). *Sight* means the ability to see, or something that is seen (e.g, *I am going to New York City to see the sights*).
#### classic style
Classic style, a term coined by Francis Noel-Thomas and Mark Turner, describes a middle style between informal and formal. It aims for clarity and economy of expression. The goal is to make writing sound like educated speech (not stuffy speech, not highfalutin speech) and to create a confident, thoughtful persona through stylistic choices that are deeper than just the surface features of text. [Here is a good summary of classic style](https://www.stafforini.com/blog/summary-of-clear-and-simple-as-the-truth/). [Here is much more on classic style, including caveats](https://classicprose.com/csguide.html#RATIONALE.COURSE). 
#### cliche
A cliche can be any overused metaphor, word, or phrase that you've heard or read so many times that any clarity or vividness it might once have had is gone. Examples: *tried and true, easier said than done, student-centered learning, at the end of the day, straight and narrow, paradigm shift, think outside the box, everyone is entitled to their own opinion*, etc. Try to avoid cliches in your own writing. Here is a [website listing common cliches](http://clichesite.com/alpha_list.asp?which=lett+1). 
#### commas with coordinating conjunctions
Bryan Garner explains [the basics of handling this tricky situation](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-198-commas-with-coordinating-conjunctions/). 
#### comma after introductory element
Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: *Before I could kill Count Dracula, I had to find a wooden stake.* Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. [The Texas A&M Writing Center explains more here](https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Punctuation/Comma-Guide).
#### comma with nonrestrictive element
Writers often stumble by not using commas with restrictive clauses. What's a restrictive clause? As the Writing Center at Texas A&M explains, "If you can eliminate the element [of the sentence] without altering \[your meaning\], then it’s a nonrestrictive element and should be marked off with commas." [More advice and explanation from A&M's Writing Center](https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Punctuation/Comma-Guide) can be found under Nonrestrictive Elements (or “Extra Stuff”).
#### comma splice (CS)
This is one of the most frequent errors that writers make. I mark comma splices as CS. If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is considered to be “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences. You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from the University of Toronto Writing Center](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/revising/comma-splices/) for help. 
#### *compliment* vs. *complement*
To *compliment* (verb) is to express raise or admiration; as a noun, it's that expression (*He paid me a compliment.*). To *complement* something is to complete it or enhance it: *The cold Coca-Cola was the perfect complement to the tacos al pastor.* See the [Oxford Dictionaries website](https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/04/13/compliment-or-complement/) for more information on these commonly confused words.
#### *is comprised of* (*comprise, compose, constitute*)
Perceived misuse of the phrase *is comprised of* is common. Bryan Garner explains the problem and offers [this advice](https://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-145-is-comprised-of/). As Garner notes, *is comprised of* is in widespread use, but some readers will continue to perceive it as inaccurate. Since part of my job is to help you understand precise usage and avoid making potential gaffes, I ask you to follow Garner's advice on the distinctions between *comprise*, *compose*, and *constitute*.
#### conclusions
Don't begin a conclusion to an essay by writing "In conclusion," "In summary," or some such. As the Harvard Writing Center explains: "These phrases can be useful--even welcome--in oral presentations. But readers can see, by the tell-tale compression of the pages, when an essay is about to end. You'll irritate your audience if you belabor the obvious."
#### court cases
Italicize the names of parties in court cases, e.g., *Roe* v. *Wade,* both in MLA style and in legal citation styles, e.g., the Bluebook style. **Nerd point**: don't italicize the "v"; so, this is correct: *Roe* v. *Wade*, but this is incorrect: *Roe v. Wade.* 
#### *counsel*, *council*, *consul*
These sound-alike words are often confused. [This handout from The University of Denver School of Law](https://www.law.du.edu/documents/aap/writing-tips-counsel-council-and-consul.pdf) can help you figure out which of these words you really mean.
#### *cut and dry*
This expression should read *cut and dried*. Confusion arises because the expression is common in speech, but not in writing, so many people don't see it written properly (or they see it written, but improperly). When you use it to modify a noun, hyphenate it as a phrasal adjective, e.g. *The administration's budget offered a cut-and-dried rationale for not increasing investment in criminal justice reform.*

# D

#### dangling and misplaced modifiers
These errors often result in sentences that are easy for readers to misunderstand or find hilarious (without your wanting them to). Your ethos and your writing's clarity both take a hit. See [this advice from the University of Minnesota Libraries](http://open.lib.umn.edu/writingforsuccess/chapter/2-7-misplaced-and-dangling-modifiers/) for how to find and fix these kinds of mistakes. 
#### decades
Do not use an apostrophe before the *s* in a decade. Incorrect: *1970's*; Correct: *1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *the '60s*
#### *deconstruct*
*Deconstruct* is not, strictly speaking, a plug-and-play synonym for *analyze, examine,* *destroy,* or *make sense of,* though I've seen writers try to use it in all of these senses, often creating avoidable confusion. *Deconstruction* is [a method of reading and an epistemic stance arising out of late 20th-Century critical theory and philosophy](https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/Jacques%20Derrida%20-%20NYT%20-%20page.htm). Most of the time, you probably don't mean *deconstruct* in this academic sense and you'd be a lot better off choosing a simpler, more direct verb.   
#### *detract* vs. *deter*
As Bryan Garner explains, *detract* can mean *to divert,* but it's much more commonly used to mean *to take something away from* (*The flies buzzing around the room detracted from my enjoyment of the tasting menu at Chez Louis*). Garner explains that the less-common use of *detract* is much better expressed as *distract*: *Some claim that Trump hopes that his tweets will ~~detract~~ distract attention from his scandals*. Sometimes, students write *detract* when they mean *deter*: *This policy change could ~~detract~~ deter students from signing up for those classes.*
#### *disconnect* as noun
Although this sort of shift in function (*disconnect* is first a verb, not a noun) is a feature of our evolving language, *disconnect* as a noun (e.g., *There's a disconnect between what the front office wants and what's going on in the warehouse*) may be too faddish and loose for some audiences, at least right now. Through simple day-to-day speech and writing, *disconnect* as a noun may well soon pass without notice as unimpeachable usage, but it isn't quite there yet.
#### *discreet* vs. *discrete*
These two words are often confused, but [they have distinct meanings.](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/discreet-or-discrete)
#### dropped quote (DQ)
In contexts outside of legal writing (which has particular conventions), ALWAYS integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. [Kyle Stedman calls this misuse of source material "Armadillo Roadkill."](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/writingspaces2/stedman--annoying-ways.pdf) Others call it a "dropped quote." A dropped quote is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: 
  * Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** 
  
The quote is simply plunked into the writing. Dropped quotes are easy to spot: they are sentences consisting only of quoted material, with no setup or lead-out in that sentence from the writer quoting the source.

Possible fix for dropped quote: 
  * Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. 

What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in. See this [advice from the UNC Writing Center](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/quotations/), as well as this advice from [Trinity University's library](https://lib.trinity.edu/integrating-sources-in-the-text-of-your-paper/).


#### *due to the fact that*
*Due to the fact that* can always be switched to a simple *because*. 
#### *dynamic*
*Dynamic* as an adjective (*dynamic teaching*) and as a noun (*the family dynamic*) is often a vague buzzword. Can you reword to clarify?


# E
#### editorial *we* or royal *we*
As Bryan Garner puts it, "It is certainly eccentric to see a solo writer using *we* and *our* when no one else is involved." In the same vein, but with more humor, Mark Twain argues: "Only kings, presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial 'we.'" Rework.
#### *effectivity*
*Effectivity* is a word, but it is a rarely used word that most readers would not know—just write *effectiveness*.
#### *elicit* and *illicit*
*Elicit,* a verb, means "to bring forth," or to "draw out." *Illicit* is an adjective, meaning *illegal* or *not allowed.* More on these two words and how to keep their meanings clear [can be found on the Oxford Dictoniaries Blog](https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2014/03/31/elicit-illicit/).
#### *every day* vs. *everyday*
*Every day,* a two-word phrase that functions as an **adverb** describes the manner or extent of something that happens regularly, e.g.  *He walks his dog every day.* *Everyday,* a one-word **adjective**, describes something that is commonplace or ordinary: *Commuting on Mopac is an everyday torment for many drivers.* 
#### existential filler
A *There is...* or *There are...* or *It is...* sentence-opener is usually filler that can be cut. Example: *There are many people who believe that Sasquatch exists.* Rework to *Many people believe that Sasquatch exists.* Such phrases in other places in a sentence can also indicate wordiness. Search for these phrases and similar ones in your writing and see whether you should rework the sentences that have them. Most existential *it is*/*there is*/*there are* statements can be cut and reworked to be less wordy and abstract.

# F

#### fake transitions
Writers in the process of drafting texts often use fake transitions. This practice is to be expected because the writer is still working out their ideas and how the ideas connect. But when you have an advanced draft, such as a "good-faith full draft" for peer review or a submission for evaluation, the text needs to be free of fake transitions. Here are some examples of fake transitions:
* To start off,...
* Moving on,.....
* Another important thing is...
* Next, I'm going to explain...

See [this advice from the UNC Writing Center on transitions](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/transitions/).
#### *female* as noun
If you mean a human being, use *girl* or *woman*--whichever is age-appropriate. Only when writing scientifically or about animals should you use *female* as a noun, e.g., *These lab rats are the males; these are the females.* 
#### *first and foremost*
This construction feels like a redundant cliche. Just write *first*.
#### *firstly [secondly*, etc.]
Current usage favors *first*, *second*, etc. [Merriam-Webster explains why](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/first-or-firstly). 
#### fused (aka run-on) sentence (FS)
I mark these **FS**. If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a fused/run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. The Writing Commons offers some good [advice on fixing fused sentences](https://writingcommons.org/section/grammar/sentences/sentence-errors/avoid-run-on-sentences/).


# G

#### *ghetto*
Use this word with caution, and only as a noun. [Here's why.](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2016/03/08/sanders-in-the-ghetto/)
#### GSAs--Giant Squishy Abstractions
GSAs (*technology, human nature, today's culture, today's society, the youth of today, this modern age*, etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

#### *hone in [on]* vs. *home in [on]*
*Hone in on* is technically wrong and always a bad choice in edited writing; the intended meaning is *home in on*, like a guided missile focuses on a target. In *Modern English Usage,* Bryan Garner explains that swapping *hone in* for *home in* is increasingly common, especially in spoken English, but is still considered a fault when one is trying to be precise (as I want you to be).
#### hyphenating phrasal adjectives
Phrasal adjectives (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

#### *impactful*
As usage expert Paul Brians argues, "Many people in business and education like to speak of things that have an impact as being 'impactful,' but this term does not appear in most dictionaries and is not well thought of by traditionalists. Use 'influential' or 'effective' instead." *Impactful* may be in dictionaries by now, but some usage experts (and I) consider it yet another awful corporate buzzword (e.g., *Let's reach out for some impactful metrics in our mobile, disruptive, next-gen solutions brainstorming.*). Take Brians' suggestions: use *influential* or *effective.*
#### *imply* vs *infer*
These two words are commonly confused. To imply is to suggest something without stating it outright. To infer is to conclude something on the basis of support or logic without its being directly evident or stated. Towson U. has a [useful page and links to exercises](https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/implyinfer.htm) about this common confusion.
#### *In conclusion*, *In summary*
**Never** end a paper or other project with *In conclusion* or *In summary* because you'll sound like a fifth-grader writing a book report. Harvard's Writing Center has some [good advice](http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions), as does the [Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/conclusions/).
#### *incredible,* *incredibly*
For some reason, students seem to love to write *incredible* and *incredibly.* I had a paper recently that had seven instances of *incredibly* in four pages. These words are hyperbolic, imprecise, and should usually be replaced. Much like the overused word *very,* *incredibly* usually signals a phrase that can be cut and then replaced by a single well-chosen adjective. 
#### indirect quote
An "indirect quote" is a source quoted in another source. For example, suppose Source A quotes and cites Source B, but you don't have Source B yourself. In MLA style use *qtd. in* to indicate the source you actually used. For example: Sherman contends that "Writing centers across the country have struggled with the problem of securing adequate resources" (qtd. in Jefferson 493). That construction signals that you are using the quotation and citation to Sherman from p. 493 of Jefferson, but you are not using the original Sherman source itself. NB: Except for use of textbook-type materials, a good researcher will try to find the original source, rather than relying on indirect quotes. In any case, you have to accurately attribute quotes to their actual sources. 
#### *infamous*
Be sure that you really mean *infamous,* which has negative connotations. Often, students write *infamous* when they mean *famous*. Merriam-Webster Dictionaries [explains the two words' meaning](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/infamous-vs-famous).
#### *in order to*, *in order for*
*In order to* and *in order for* can usually be cut to *to* or *for* without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
#### *X is interesting* claims
*Interesting* is, well, interesting since it can mean many things. Because anything can be *interesting* in various ways, it is usually vague and ineffective to leave your own claims at the level of asserting that *X is interesting*, *X is an interesting phenomenon*, or some such. *X is interesting* is roughly the same as asserting "*So...thats a thing*." So what? What, specifically, about X is worth building an argument around? What about that is arguable and supportable with sound evidence? 
#### in-text citations and closing punctuation--MLA and APA format
The in-text citation is part of the sentence, so the closing punctuation (typically a period) of your sentence containing the citation goes **after** the closing parenthesis of the citation. So, like this (MLA example): Smith argues that "if students can be taught to develop a set of help-seeking behaviors, their peformance in writing courses "can exceed all predicted outcomes" (65). <---See that period after the closing parenthesis? See that the closing quotation mark goes **before** the opening parenthesis?
#### in-text citations and shortening titles (MLA)
It's tedious and unnecessary to keep repeating a long title of a source in an in-text citation. [Writing Commons offers this advice](https://writingcommons.org/open-text/collaboration/167-common-comments/in-text-citations-/625-abbreviate-the-title-of-this-source-in-the-citation) on shortening titles meaningfully.
#### *issue* vs. *problem*
If you mean *problem*, you should just write *problem*. Many people use *issue* as a synonym, but it's imprecise. Rework.  
#### *its* vs. *it's*
*Its* is the possessive of *it*: *The monkey played with its tail*. *Its* means "belonging to it." *It's* is a contraction for *it is*: *It's important to know how to cook.* Try reading your writing aloud, saying "it is" when you come across "it's." If you meant "it is," then the contraction "it's" is correct. If you did not mean "it is," you have mistakenly written "it's" when you meant "its" (the possessive of it). [The Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/its-or-it-s) explain more.

# J
#### *judgment* vs. *judgement*
In American spelling, it's *judgment* (*judgement* is UK spelling).

# L 

#### *less* vs. *fewer*
See [this advice from Bryan Garner:](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-144-less-vs-fewer/]) "Use *fewer* when referring to individual or countable things (*fewer than ten chairs*, *fewer questions asked by judges*). Use *less* when referring to volume, quantity, or degree (*less influence on the jurors*), mass or bulk nouns (*less water in the glass*), or units of measure or time (*less than three ounces,* *less than five months*). There is one exception: use *less* when count nouns are really being used as amounts instead of individual increments (he has *less* than one million dollars*, *We have less than two minutes of rebuttal time*)."
#### *lie* and *lay*
Errors with these irregular verbs are common. [Here is some solid advice](http://web.ku.edu/~edit/lie.html) and a way to double-check your usage. 
#### *like* vs. *such as*
Strict usage sticklers insist that *like* (in this sense) means "similar to," while *such as* introduces examples. This so-called rule may never have been a rule in the first place, but some readers insist upon it. In general, it might be a good idea to ask whether you mean to focus on the class of things (drawing similarities) or on examples and choose accordingly. I have read that academic writing favors *such as* because it often uses examples, but I have not seen the support for that position myself. A [history and synopsis of this usage question](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/02/like-such-as.html) can be found at the Grammarphobia blog. 
#### *Look at/looking at*/*look into*/*talk about*
These phrases as synonyms for *analyze*, *explain*, or *examine* are okay in informal speech and informal writing, but you're probably better off being precise and just writing *analyze,* *explain*, *examine,* or some such in most of your expository writing.

# M
#### *make use of*
All this means is "use," so just write "use."
#### *Meaning that*
If you begin a sentence *Meaning that....*, you are probably trying to express something like *In other words,...* *Meaning that....* usually indicates a sentence fragment.
#### *medium*, *media*
*Media* as a mass noun is perfectly okay: *The media are investigating Anthony Weiner's tweets.* When referring to a single medium, such as TV, radio, etc., use *medium.* When referring to more than one medium, use *media,* never *mediums*: *Shep Gordon has promoted a variety of artists in several media: live performance, television, films, and books.* *Mediums* is the plural of *medium,* i.e., a person who claims to be in contact with the spirit world: *Madame Xsaya is a medium who charges $500 for a seance* or sizes of things: *Old Navy was sold out of large T-shirts--I could only find mediums.* 
#### *moreso*
The one-word spelling *moreso* is gaining in usage and at least one dictionary accepts it. Still, though, most usage is of the two-word phrase *more so.* Maybe in ten years, *moreso* will be fully accepted, but it's not there yet.

# N
#### names
When referring to someone by name, use first name and last name the first time you mention them (*Kenneth Burke*), then last name from that point forward (*Later, Burke adds that....*). You don't need to keep repeating their first and last names together. If you have two people with the same last name, you'll have to bend this rule so as to keep clear who you mean. 

Watch out when you use first names--generally, most analytical or expository writing uses last names. Using someone's first name often creates a tone problem, a problem that is magnified if you refer to men as *Mr. So and So*, but revert to first names when referring to women (odd tone becomes sexist tone).

#### *not only*....*but also*
Keep this parallel. Don't forget the *also* after *but.*

#### *novel*
A novel is a long work of narrative fiction, often published in the form of a book. But just because something is a book doesn't make it a novel. Just because something is a sandwich doesn't make it a turkey sub. If you don't know how to classify that book you intend to use and cite in your research, just ask me and I will be happy to help you.

#### numbers in sentences
Journalistic (AP) style allows you to start a sentence with a number if the number is a year, but my courses do not use journalistic style. Don't start sentences with numbers. See [that, and other, rules for using numbers](https://www.grammarbook.com/numbers/numbers.asp) in a sentence, such as when to spell them out, writing fractions, monetary amounts, etc.

# O
#### *obviously*
This word can usually be cut. It adds little to something that you have shown already (if you have shown it clearly, there is no need to lard it up with *obviously*). 
#### *OK*
In class projects, it's *OK* or *okay,* (or even *O.K.,* but this is relatively uncommon). It is never *ok* (unless maybe you are quoting a text message or someething). *OK* is always casual, so consider whether you should replace it in precise writing occasions. 
#### *only* misplaced
Bryan Garner argues that "The word *only* is probably misplaced more often than any other modifier," and Mignon Fogarty calls *only* "the most insidious misplaced modifier." Where *only* goes can radically alter the meaning of the sentence. See [the five examples here](http://www.shearsoneditorial.com/2012/02/adverb-placement-predominantly-mainly-mostly/). See also [Garner's advice](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-129-placement-of-only/). Read your writing aloud and ask yourself where the *only* should be placed to emphasize what you really meant to emphasize.
#### *over time* vs. *overtime*
*Over time* is an adverb phrase and means "over a period of time" or "gradually." *Overtime* is a noun; it names what hourly employees can collect if asked to work extra hours or what happens if a sporting contest (say, a basketball game) isn't resolved during regulation time. 

# P

#### *pallet* vs. *palette* vs. *palate*
These words sound alike and are easy to confuse. A *pallet* is a flat wooden support structure that is used to move goods or materials, usually by means of a forklift. A *palette*, in the physical sense, is handheld surface on which an artist mixes paint colors; in the metaphorical sense, it is a range of colors, e.g., *HGTV is largely responsible for ruining Americans' aesthetic senses because it has saturated cable TV with remodeling shows that draw from a limited color palette of whites and grays.* Your *palate*, in the physical sense, is the roof of your mouth; in the metaphorical sense, it is your ability to discern and appreciate flavors and tastes, as in *The wine expert has a very sophisticated palate* or *The rule in my house growing up was that we had to try all foods at least once so that we could develop our palates.*
#### paragraph length
Generally speaking, paragraphs should be built around one core idea (which is usually part of a larger idea) and everything in the paragraph is germane to some facet of that idea. There is no ideal paragraph length, and different occasions, audiences, and genres might create different expectations for those contexts. In most essayistic writing, one- or two-sentence paragraphs are seen as underdeveloped and ineffective. Extremely long paragraphs, generally those more than about three-quarters of a page, might be exhausting and create information overload. [The Purdue OWL has some good advice on paragraphing](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html), including some advice on how you might judge when a new paragraph is necessary. 
#### Paramedic Method
Richard Lanham's famous Paramedic Method for revising sentences helps you to rework vague, wordy, bureaucratic-sounding prose. [The Purdue OWL explains this easy, effective method](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paramedic_method.html).
#### passive voice
You should have a strong bias favoring active voice (*Lincoln delivered the speech*) over passive voice (*The speech was delivered by Lincoln*), unless you have a specific reason for using passive voice. Passive voice is not **wrong**; it’s just (usually) weaker. For more details, see [this handout from our Writing Center](https://sites.stedwards.edu/writing/files/2015/09/St.-Edwards-Univ-Writing-Center-Handout-on-Passive-Voice-19nzb1n.pdf). 
#### *peak* vs. *pique*
It's *pique* interest, not *peak.* The words sound identical, but are spelled differently and have different meanings. *Peak* means "highest point," but *pique* means "to stimulate, excite, or arouse," and is almost always followed by "curiosity" or "interest" as the feeling being excited.
#### *per,* *as per,* *as per usual/per usual*
I agree with Bryan Garner that *per* is an avoidable Latinism that should simply be replaced with *under*, *according to,* or the like. *As per* is doubly clunky since it is both a Latinism and redundant bit of bizspeak, giving the reader nothing more than the already-clunky *per* gives. Finally, as Garner argues (and I agree), the phrase *as per usual/per usual* is "an embarassing barbarism" that one should never write. 
#### periods or other closing punctuation, spaces after
Use [one space after a period or other closing punctuation](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/OneSpaceorTwo.html) in Loewe classes and in most situations when you're writing to people who understand typography. However, a few specific audiences still want two spaces after a period, including [the APA (in preparing manuscripts](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/24/)--I'd like to see the resulting printed journals from these manuscripts, which likely do not have two spaces). 
#### people vs entities: pronouns
Is it *it/its* or *they/theirs* when referring to groups of people, companies, institutions, countries? Students often write *they/their* when it should be *it/its*. See [this advice](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/people-versus-entities).
#### *piece of rhetoric* (or *rhetoric piece/rhetorical piece,* etc.)
Please do not write about rhetorical artifacts or occasions as "piece(s) of rhetoric." Sometimes, articles or op-eds or similar writings are informally called "pieces," but "piece of rhetoric" makes no sense. Rhetoric is not reducible to any particular artifact or contained within it. Finally, nobody in the discipline uses the term "piece of rhetoric," so it's best to avoid that phrase.
#### *principal* vs *principle*
Writers often confuse these two words. They have nothing to do with each other, though they sound alike. Bryan Garner explains that *principle* is most commonly a noun (e.g., *the principle of charity,* *the Peter principle*), but *principal* can be an adjective meaning "first or most important" (*the principal reason she lost the case*) or a noun (e.g., *the school principal* or *the loan's principal*). 
#### *problematic*
*Problematic* is often used to flag a statement, an idea, or a representation as wrong, pernicious, or troubling in some way, at least from the perspective of the person labeling it *problematic.* There's nothing inherently wrong with *problematic,* except it has been used so often and in so many contexts (ranging from the truly troubling to the mildly annoying or even frivolous) that it is in danger of devolving into a mere cliche. Bryan Garner has no problem with it, calling it "standard" usage (Source: *Garner's Modern English Usage*, 4th ed.). But it has become so common and so readily deployed that--at least in my opinion--it is in danger of becoming a placeholder for an argument rather than a precise term that enables argument. So: use with caution and consider rewording for precision. 

# Q

#### quotation marks, single vs. double
In American usage, double quotation marks start a quotation and single quotation marks are for material quoted inside that quote: *Jones agrees with this point, adding that "Whenever he had a few too many Red Bulls, I often heard Dr. Doom claim that he was 'sure to vanquish that pesky Spider-Man'" (67).* Use double quotations for those ironic, sarcastic quotation marks that distance you from the term or material within the quotation marks: *This "innovation" that the consultant touted is not worth the effort.* These are sometimes called *shudder quotes* and have the effect of adding "so-called": *This [so-called] "innovation."* Use shudder quotes sparingly--a writer who leans too heavily on them comes off as snarky, hectoring, or tedious. 
#### quotation marks with other punctuation 
Students often mistakenly place periods and commas outside of quotation marks when they should be inside (in US usage). See [Bryan Garner's advice](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-160-correct-punctuation-with-quotation-marks/).

# R

#### *reach out to*
*Reach out to* is voguish bizspeak for *contact, call, write*, or some other specific verb. *Reach out to* is becoming common usage, but many readers (I am one) find it grating, vague, and wordy. A specific single verb is probably best.
#### *reason[s] as to why*
This phrase expresses nothing more than writing *reason[s] why*; *as to* should be cut in all cases. Try also to cut *why* and see if the sentence can be improved. *Reason[s] why* is mildly redundant, but (according to Garner), well-established and accepted. 
#### *reason is because*
This phrase can always be modified. *Because* expresses a causal reason. *The reason is that* would be better, but try reworking the sentence to just get to the X because Y idea cleanly.
#### *relatable*
*Relatable* is a vague word that many readers, including me, dislike. When students use *relatable*, they usually mean to express something about identification, empathy, or appealing to an audience. Can you reword to be clearer? 
####  *relate to*
That X "relates to" Y explains almost nothing. Here is an exaggerated illustration: I "relate to" the planet Neptune because we are in the same solar system. So what? Can you reword to be clearer? Do you mean *identify with*, *understand*, or some relationship between X and Y that is about a particular kind of relevance or connection?
#### *reveal* as noun
This reality-show buzzword is becoming more and more common in everyday parlance, but it often causes a weird tone in academic or professional writing, making it borrow a hackneyed TV trope ("the big reveal"). In writing, stick to using *reveal* just as a verb and find some other way to express the thought. 

# S

#### *said* [for *this,* *those,* or *that*]
If you mean *that* or *those*, write *that* or *those.* *Said* sounds like a legalese-loving attorney, not like a human being communicating something important.
#### semicolons in series
If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. 
#### sentence fragment (SF)
I mark these **SF**. Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. *Like this. Really*. Usually, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/sentence_fragments.html). [The University of Arizona](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ordover/ENGL102/_ENGL102/OnlineHelpfulDocs/correcting_fragments.pdf) has some more advice.
#### serial comma aka "Oxford comma"
I favor the serial comma (aka “Oxford comma") because it enhances clarity. [Definition and examples](https://style.mla.org/serial-commas-and-semicolons/)
#### *setup* vs. *set up*
These sound identical, and involve similar concepts, but are not interchangeable. *Setup* is a noun that means "the way that things are arranged" (*The conference room setup includes three whiteboards"). *Set up* is a verb phrase, meaning the action of preparing something or arranging it; it often brackets its object: set X up. (*To set students up for success, the professor gave them a packet of previous years' exams*).
#### sexist language
[Garner offers strategies](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-3/) for reworking sentences to avoid a generic masculine pronoun and for [handling words that traditionally end in -man](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-5/) (e.g., *fireman* becomes *firefighter*). 
#### *showcase*
If you mean *show* or *demonstrate* or *establish,* you should just write those words. *Showcase* has become (to my mind, anyway), an overused and hyperbolic-sounding buzzword. 
#### [*sic*]
When a source truly misspells something or is ungrammatical, but you are quoting it exactly anyway for some good reason, use [*sic*] so readers know that the fault is not yours. [Bryan Garner offers more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sic/), including advice about when not to use [*sic*]. Another option is to alter the quote responsibly to fix the error. See the [Purdue OWL's advice on altering source material in a quotation](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/02/).
#### *significant*
*Significant* has become a fraught word because of abuses and misunderstandings of the concept of **statistical significance**, which [Diane F. Halpern explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11693), [Charles Seife explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25414), and from confusions about the related concept of effect size, which [Bruce Hood explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25414). Be sure to understand how any of your sources is using (or abusing) *significance* in the scientific sense, and consider alternative adjectives in your own writing. If you are relying on p-values, read [the American Statistical Association's statement on p-values](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf) and talk the project over with a subject-matter expert.
#### slash mark
The slash mark, also sometimes called a *virgule*, is the source of much ambiguity and ineffective writing. You should generally avoid it, unless it's in a well-known phrase such as *he said/she said*. But writers often use the slash to mean *or, *and, *X or Y, or both*, leaving readers guessing as to which possibility is the intended one. Rework to use whatever words express the intended relationship rather than leaning on the ambiguity-spawning slash mark.  
#### *study*
If a source did a "study" of something, you have to unpack that for the reader. Of course, there's nothing wrong with using the word "study" to describe some scientific or social-scientific examination of a question and report of findings. But I want to make you aware that writers often fail to sufficiently understand what the particular study is all about and can unwittingly participate in creating misunderstandings. Just telling a reader something like *Smith studied undergraduate writers and found X (67)* is not in fact telling the reader much of value. Whenever you read or hear the word "study," you should ask questions about **who or what was studied exactly, how it was studied, what the sample size was, what the control group was, what the limitations on the findings were, where was the study published**, etc. Unpack those basics for your reader so you understand the importance of the study and why it helps you to explain or argue something. Just reporting the bottom-line finding is usually not enough. See [this article](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/10_questions_to_ask_about_scientific_studies) for more advice and critical questions to answer.

#### subject-verb mismatch (SV)
I mark these SV. Subjects and verbs must agree (that is, match) in your sentences. Errors in subject-verb agreement are rare among writers proficient in English, but even among those writers, they can appear in tricky situations, such as when the subject of the sentence is compound (joined by *and*). The writing center at the University of Wisconsin offers [useful advice on subject-verb agreement](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/subject-verb-agreement). 


# T

#### *that* vs. *which*
In American usage, favor *that* over  *which,* unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use *which* plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use *that* to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky.* EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip."* Bryan Garner offers [more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-that-1/).
#### *that*, wrongly suppressed
Bryan Garner: "In formal writing *that* is often ill-advisedly omitted, creating a miscue or an ambiguity, even if only momentarily. In particular, the conjunction that should usually be retained to introduce clauses following verbs such as *acknowledge, ask, believe, claim, doubt, hold, indicate, say*, and *suggest*. [More here on the "wrongly suppressed *that*](http://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-127-wrongly-suppressed-that/).
#### terminal punctuation
In text messages or other rapid, informal communication, writers often write sentences that omit terminal (ending) punctuation, especially periods. I do that myself. Some people even perceive periods in text messages as setting an abrupt tone. **But** in the writing you will do in college assignments, the reader may consider you careless or incompetent if you don't end your sentences with a punctuation mark (again, most often a period). Missing terminal punctuation is easy to catch by using spell checkers and by reading your writing aloud--but you have to be aware of the different discourse and genre expectations and have a plan for finding missteps.
#### *they,* singular 
[Bryan Garner has covered this masterfully](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-4/). I accept the singular *they* because it has a long history of use, it solves the English language's common-sex singular personal pronoun glitch, and it avoids sexism. The singular *they* can also be used to refer to people who don't identify as male or female. Much more on that [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34901704). Avoid convoluted constructions such as *his/her* and the like. Sentences can often be reworked to avoid the pronoun, too.
#### *their/there/they're*
These words are sometimes confused, especially *their* and *there*. *Their* means "belonging to them," as in *The sisters ran back to their house.* More and more, *their* is used as the possesive of the singular *they* (see entry above). *There* means two things: a) "over there/not here," as in *I walked away, leaving him standing there in the rain.* and b) to introduce the existence of something, as in *There are a lot of people here today.* (but see entry on *existential filler*). Finally, *they're* is a contraction for "they are," as in *Where are my books? They're on the table.*
#### *third-world country; the Third World*
These phrases are common, but historically inaccurate, vague, and often considered offensive. See [this article from NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/04/372684438/if-you-shouldnt-call-it-the-third-world-what-should-you-call-it) on why you should not use these phrases, and what your alternatives might be. 
#### *this* (vague *this*, sometimes called the *unattended this* or *naked this*)
I haven't tracked it empirically, but I have many years of anecdotal observations to support this statement: students' uses of the pronoun *this* are often vague. I'd go so far as to contend that the majority of students' uses of *This* to start a sentence are vague. Consider whether your uses of *this* (especially at the beginning of the sentence) are clear as to what is being pointed back to by the *this.* **Always ask: “This what?” because your readers will be asking that same question.** 

#### titles, articles in periodicals, chapters in edited collections of scholary essays
Titles of articles in periodicals (newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals) and chapters in edited collections of scholarly essays should be in quotation marks, in title case, no italics, no bolding: Lucas, Brad E. and Drew M. Loewe. “Coordinating Citations and the Cartography of Knowledge: Finding True North in Five Scholarly Journals.” *The Changing of Knowledge in Composition: Contemporary Perspectives*, edited by Richard Gebhardt and Lance Massey, Utah State UP, 2011, pp. 264-82.
#### titles, blog posts or single pages from a website
Use quotation marks. Examples: "Decrying Dialects and Despising Speakers, "About Us," "Our Mission," "Something is Wrong on the Internet."
#### titles, books
Italicize book titles. No quotation marks. Ex.: *A Rhetoric of Motives*, *The Hobbit*, *The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications*.
#### titles, films
In MLA style, film titles are italicized: *The Godfather*, *Shrek*, *Sharknado*. Other styles, such as the *New York Times* style sheet, use double quotation marks: "The Godfather," "Shrek," "Sharknado."
#### titles, music
In MLA style, song titles are set off with quotation marks: "Welcome to the Terrordome," "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Album titles are italicized: *Houses of the Holy,* *Q: Are We Not Men? A: We are Devo!*
#### titles, periodicals
Titles of periodicals (newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals) should be italicized: *New York Times,* the *Times* article, *Rhetoric Review,* *National Geographic,* *Lucky Peach.* 
#### titles, plays
In MLA style, play titles are italicized: *The Book of Mormon,* *Hamlet,* *Glengarry Glen Ross.* The titles of short plays, e.g., one-act plays, are in quotation marks: "This Is a Test," "Two Guys in a Bar." Individual numbers (songs) in a musical are titled in quotation marks: "Man Up," "Aaron Burr, Sir." 
#### titles, TV shows
In MLA style, italicize the titles of TV programs: *The Wire,* *Monday Night Football*. Use quotation marks for titles of individual episodes: The “Amok Time” episode of *Star Trek*
#### *toward* vs *towards*
You should, in US English contexts, favor *toward* over *towards.* Brian Garner explains that *toward* has been preferred in US English usage "[s]ince about 1900."
#### transfer errors, Spanish to English
If you are used to thinking, speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish, and are now trying to write university-level American English, you will make certain patterns of errors. That's completely understandable and normal. Cuando escribo en espa&#241;ol, yo tambien hago errores. Los que leen lo que escribo van a saber que espa&#241;ol no es mi idioma mas entendida. [Here is a helpful link to common Spanish-to-English transfer errors](https://resources.jjay.cuny.edu/erc/tutoring/pdfs/52.pdf) and how to find and change them. 
#### *try and*
*Try and* should probably be *try to*. While *try and* is an accepted informal and (especially) spoken form of expressing *try to,* you can never go wrong by writing *try to.* Oddly, *try and* is standard in UK usage, according to Garner. But in US academic or legal contexts, stick to *try to.* 

# U
#### *utilize* (vs *use*)
Some people [claim that there is a meaningful distinction between these words](http://throwgrammarfromthetrain.blogspot.com/2013/12/using-utilize-what-mavens-say.html), but I am not convinced. In my view, *utilize* is always inferior to *use* because it is bureucratic-sounding, elliptical, and unnecessarily burdensome. 

# V

#### verbs, precise
Forms of: *says, writes, states, thinks*, and *feels* are usually less vivid or precise than other verbs you can choose. Try to choose a verb that most accurately characterizes the action you are trying to show. Here is a [list of precise verbs](https://tutoring.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Annotation%20Verbs.pdf) that you will find useful in replacing weak verbs (but try to stay away from *thinks* or *writes,* which are on that list).
#### *verses* and *versus*
*Verses* are parts of the Bible, songs, or poems. *Versus* means *in opposition to*. These words sound identical and thus are easy to confuse, but they have entirely different meanings.
#### *very*
*Very* should often be cut. It is usually a filler word. *Very* followed by an adjective usually signals a weak construction that should be tightened by cutting *very* and choosing a precise adjective. Examples: *very smart* (try *brilliant)*, *very important* (try *essential*), or *very old* (try *ancient*). 
#### *very unique*
*Very unique* is a phrase that should be used with caution in edited writing. [The folks at Merriam-Webster explain why](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/very-unique-and-absolute-adjectives) (scroll to bottom of page).

#### *whether or not*
Bryan Garner reminds us that "Despite the superstition to the contrary, the words *or not* are usually superfluous, since *whether* implies *or not.*" But, he adds, "*or not* is necessary when *whether or not* means 'regardless of whether' [e.g.,] *the meeting will go on whether or not it rains*." More than half of the student uses of *whether* that I've seen are of the first kind, making *or not* superfluous. 
#### *who, whom*
[Bryan Garner offers some excellent advice.](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-176-who-vs-whom/)
#### *who vs. that* 
The [Purdue OWL summarizes the current thinking on *who* vs. *that*](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/645/01/): "When referring to people, both *that* and *who* can be used in informal language. *That* may be used to refer to the characteristics or abilities of an individual or a group of people: *He is the kind of person that/who will never let you down.*[...] However, when speaking about a particular person in formal language, *who* is preferred: *The man who lives next door is a teacher.*" In my opinion, using *who* for people preserves something special about being a person, if indeed there is something special about being a person--certainly, many people still think so. *That* sounds a bit like you're referring to an object, so it's frowned upon slightly in some quarters. Technically, though, *that* is correct and has a long history of usage. 
#### *work out* vs. *workout*
To *work out* is a verb phrase that means to exercise (*Early each morning, the basketball star leaves her house to work out*), to negotiate or argue (*They met to work out their differences*), or to figure something out (*I used the clues to work out a solution to the escape room puzzle.*). A *workout* is typically a program of exercise (*He is sore today because of yesterday's grueling workout*).
#### *would be* as odd substitute for *is/was/were*
Writers often use *would be* as an odd substitute for forms of the verb *to be.* Compare: *The best golfer on the tour would be Jordan Spieth.* Unless you are expressing something about the future, you don't need *would be* when you could just write *is* or *was*: *The best golfer on the tour is Jordan Spieth.*
