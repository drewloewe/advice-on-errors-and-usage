## Introduction
This guide is an ever-evolving list of advice on errors and usage. It's based on the comments that I find myself giving to St. Edward's University students over and over. As a result, it reflects local concerns and my own biases and preferences. I hope that it's broad enough to be useful, but it can't be comprehensive. Read Bryan Garner's *Modern English Usage* and the whole [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/) if you want comprehensive. In particular, Garner's book is an outstanding small investment (<$50) that any serious writer should consider making.

NB: This guide assumes MLA citation style. MLA style is certainly not the only (or best) citation style, but it is widely used in humanities courses. In Legal Writing, though, we will use a version of the Texas "Greenbook" style.

# A

#### *is/was able to*
When describing something someone else did, wrote, or said, students often write that the other person *is/was able to* do, write, or say such and such. If someone actually did something, then it follows that they must have been able to do that thing. The problem is one of emphasis: is the emphasis on the thing that they did, or on their ability to do it? Compare: *Richard Sherman was able to intercept Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.// Richard Sherman intercepted Tom Brady's pass, ending the Patriots' drive.* Where do you want the emphasis? If some precondition is or was necessary to the action, and you want to bring all that out in your sentence, *is/was able to* can be okay: *By watching the receiver's eyes, Richard Sherman was able to time his jump just right to intercept Tom Brady's pass.* 
#### *aid* vs. *aide*
*Aid* as a verb means to help or assist; *aid* as a noun means some sort of assistance, e.g., *financial aid.* *Aide* means a staff member that you supervise or direct, e.g., *Wary of causing offense, the President brought his aide for protocol to the state dinner with the Prime Minister of Freedonia.* 
#### *affect* vs. *effect*
[Paul Brians explains the correct usage of these commonly confused words](http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/affect.html).
#### *aforementioned*
Assuming that the reference to something that came before is clear (is it?), this stuffy, legalese-sounding word can be replaced with some other pointing word such as *these, that,* or *those.* Rather than using *aforementioned,* which creates tone problems, rewrite for clarity.
#### *a lot*
*A lot* is an informal way of expressing a large quantity when formality and specifics don't matter (*He ate a lot of green beans yesterday. A lot of the first-down plays were short passes over the middle.*) Generally, in formal writing, *a lot* comes across as vague or imprecise. Try reworking it. Also, *alot* is always wrong.
#### *alright* vs *all right*
*Alright* is definitely not standard usage and is likely to be seen as a blunder by many audiences. In informal contexts and genres, nobody might care if you write *alright.* But in college and workplace writing, stick to *all right* as a two-word phrase and you'll be *all right.* 
#### *among* vs *amongst*
In American English (and assuming expository writing), there is no reason to write the stuffy and old-fashioned-sounding *amongst.* Just write *among.* 
#### *and/or*
Although some use people *and/or* as a crutch, don't use it in your own writing. In the words of the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th ed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), Rule 5.220 at 266: "Avoid this Janus-faced term. It can often be replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning. Where it seems needed . . . , try "or" . . . or both (e.g., "take a sleeping pill or a warm drink or both"). But think of other possibilities."
#### apostrophe error
The Purdue OWL [has some great advice on using apostrophes](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/).
#### *as humans*, *we as humans*, *as people*
These phrases usually come across as wooly, abstract clutter. Rework for clarity or simply cut.
#### *as such*
Bryan Garner: "Take care when using this phrase. Good usage requires employing *as such* only if you can replace it with “as [some noun just mentioned].” Never use *as such* to express causation (instead, use *thus,* *therefore,* or *so*). [Read more from Garner on this phrase](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-179-as-such/)
#### *at this time* / *at this point in time*
These phrases say nothing more than *now,* so you should probably just use *now.*



# B

#### *based off*, *based off of*, *based around*
Logically, nothing can be "based off of/off/around" something else. Just write *based on.*
#### *begs the question* vs. *raises the question*
Begging the question is a logical fallacy of circular argument, e.g., "God created the world because the Bible says so." Using *beg the question* to mean *raise the question* is certain to annoy traditionalists (on this, I am a traditionalist) because they see it as imprecise. 
#### *being that*
Never write *being that* to mean *because.* Just write *because.*
#### *blatant, blatantly*
As Bryan Garner explains, "What is blatant stands out glaringly or repungnantly." *Blatant* has a pejorative connotation, e.g., *A blatant lie.* Often, students write *blatant* when they mean something like *vivid* or another non-pejorative adjective describing something that stands out.
#### Britishisms
Avoid Britishisms (e.g., *colour, humour, whilst, centre, spilt*) in American contexts. 
#### *broadcasted*
The past tense of *broadcast is *braadcast,* not *broadasted.* *Broadcasted* seems logical, but its usage in quality print sources is far outweighed by *broadcast.* So, *The show was broadcast on March 7, 1989* is correct. 
#### buried verb
A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a *–tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance*, or *–ity* ending added (e.g., *realization* instead of *realize*). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

#### capitalization, general
The [Purdue OWL explains the rules for using capital letters](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/592/1/). NB: When referring to someone by title, capitalize the title if it precedes their name: *President Lincoln.* Don't capitalize titles that refer generically to the idea of the title: *College presidents need to listen to faculty.* Don't capitalize titles that come after the name: *Ted Cruz is a senator who has not always gotten along with his own party.* But: *Senator Cruz spoke at the luncheon.* 
#### capitalization, *armed forces*
"Capitalize only as a proper name (*Armed Forces Day*), not as a noun (*the armed forces*) or adjective (*an armed-forces member*). Lower case unless part of a title or when preceded by *U.S.*, as in *U.S. Armed Forces*." Source: [US Navy Style Guide](http://www.navy.mil/tools/view_styleguide_all.asp).
#### capitalization of *Black/black, White/white*, etc.
This is a fraught issue and I have read well-reasoned arguments for and against capitalization. The *Columbia Journalism Review* offers [a good discussion](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/language_corner_1.php) of the issues and choices involved. 
#### classic style
Classic style, a term coined by Francis Noel-Thomas and Mark Turner, describes a middle style between informal and formal. It aims for clarity and economy of expression. The goal is to make writing sound like educated speech (not stuffy speech, not highfalutin speech) and to create a confident, thoughtful persona through stylistic choices. [Much more on classic style, including caveats](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/), can be found on my website. I also encourage you to [read more about it from Thomas and Turner themselves](http://drewloewe.net/prose-style/).
#### cliche
A cliche can be any overused metaphor, word, or phrase that you've heard or read so many times that any clarity or vividness it might once have had is gone. Examples: *tried and true, easier said than done, student-centered learning, at the end of the day, straight and narrow, paradigm shift, think outside the box, everyone is entitled to their own opinion*, etc. Try to avoid cliches in your own writing. Here is a [website listing common cliches](http://clichesite.com/alpha_list.asp?which=lett+1). 
#### commas with coordinating conjunctions
Bryan Garner explains [the basics of handling this tricky situation](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-198-commas-with-coordinating-conjunctions/). 
#### comma after introductory element
Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: *Before I could kill Count Dracula, I had to find a wooden stake.* Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. [The Purdue OWL explains more here](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/03/).
#### comma splice
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences. You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from the Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/engagement/2/1/34/) for help. 
#### conclusions
Don't begin a conclusion to an essay by writing "In conclusion," "In summary," or some such. As the Harvard Writing Center explains: "These phrases can be useful--even welcome--in oral presentations. But readers can see, by the tell-tale compression of the pages, when an essay is about to end. You'll irritate your audience if you belabor the obvious."
#### court cases
Italicize the names of parties in court cases, e.g., *Roe v. Wade,* both in MLA style and in legal citation style that you'll use if you take Legal Writing. 

# D

#### dangling and misplaced modifiers
These errors often result in sentences that are easy for readers to misunderstand or find (without you wanting them to) hilarious. Either way, your ethos and your writing's clarity both take a hit. See [this advice from the University of Minnesota Libraries](http://open.lib.umn.edu/writingforsuccess/chapter/2-7-misplaced-and-dangling-modifiers/) for how to find and fix these kinds of mistakes. 
#### decades
Do not use an apostrophe before the *s* in a decade. Incorrect: *1970's*; Correct: *1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *the '60s*
#### *deconstruct*
*Deconstruct* is not, strictly speaking, a plug-and-play synonym for *analyze, examine,* *destroy,* or *make sense of,* though I've seen writers try to use it in all of these senses, often creating avoidable confusion. *Deconstruction* is [a method of reading and an epistemic stance arising out of late 20th-Century critical theory and philosophy](https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/Jacques%20Derrida%20-%20NYT%20-%20page.htm). Most of the time, you probably don't mean *deconstruct* in this academic sense and you'd be a lot better off choosing a simpler, more direct verb.   
#### *detract* vs. *deter*
As Bryan Garner explains, *detract* can mean *to divert,* but it's much more commonly used to mean *to take something away from* (*The flies buzzing around the room detracted from my enjoyment of the tasting menu at Chez Louis*). Garner explains that the less-common use of *detract* is much better expressed as *distract*: *Some claim that Trump hopes that his tweets will ~~detract~~ distract attention from his scandals*. Sometimes, students write *detract* when they mean *deter*: *This policy change could ~~detract~~ deter students from signing up for those classes.*
#### *disconnect* as noun
Although this sort of shift in function (*disconnect* is first a verb, not a noun) is a feature of our evolving language, *disconnect* as a noun (e.g., *There's a disconnect between what the front office wants and what's going on in the warehouse"*) may be too faddish and loose for some audiences, at least right now. Through simple day-to-day speech and writing, *disconnect* as a noun may well soon pass without notice as unimpeachable usage, but it isn't quite there yet.
#### dropped quote
Always integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. A “dropped quote” is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** The quote is simply plunked into the writing. 

Possible fix: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in as if it stops the conversation of your paper. 
#### *due to the fact that*
*Due to the fact that* can always be switched to a simple *because*. 
#### *dynamic*
*Dynamic* as an adjective (*dynamic teaching*) and as a noun (*the family dynamic*) is often a vague buzzword. Can you reword to clarify?


# E
#### editorial *we*/royal *we*
As Bryan Garner puts it, "It is certainly eccentric to see a solo writer using *we* and *our* when no one else is involved." In the same vein, but with more humor, Mark Twain argues: "Only kings, presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial 'we.'" Rework.
#### *effectivity*
*Effectivity* is a word, but it is a high unusual word that most readers would not know—just write *effectiveness*.
#### *elicit* and *illicit*
*Elicit,* a verb, means "to bring forth," or to "draw out." *Illicit* is an adjective, meaning *illegal* or *not allowed.* More on these two words and how to keep their meanings clear [can be found on the Oxford Dictoniaries Blog](https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2014/03/31/elicit-illicit/).
#### existential filler
A *There is...* or *There are...* sentence-opener is usually mere filler that can be cut. Example: *There are many people who believe that Sasquatch exists.* Rework to *Many people believe that Sasquatch exists.* *There is* and *there are* in other places in a sentence also can indicate wordiness. Search for these phrases and similar ones (*there was, there were*) in your writing and see whether you should rework sentences that have them.

# F

#### *female* as noun
If you mean a human being, use *girl* or *woman*--whichever is age-appropriate. Only when writing scientifically or about animals should you use *female* as a noun, e.g., *These lab rats are the males; these are the females.* 
#### *first and foremost*
This construction feels like a redundant cliche. Just write *first*.
#### fragment (sentence fragment)
Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. *Like this. Really*. Usually, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/). 
#### fused (aka run-on) sentence
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a fused/run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. [Advice on fused sentences from the Center for Writing Studies, UIUC](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/fusedsentences/).


# G

#### *ghetto*
Use this word with caution, and only as a noun. [Here's why.](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2016/03/08/sanders-in-the-ghetto/)
#### GSAs--Giant Squishy Abstractions
GSAs (*technology, human nature, today's culture, today's society, the youth of today, this modern age*, etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

#### *hone in [on]* vs. *home in [on]*
*Hone in on* is technically wrong and always a bad choice in edited writing; the intended meaning is *home in on*, like a guided missile focuses on a target. In *Modern English Usage,* Bryan Garner explains that swapping *hone in* for *home in* is increasingly common, especially in spoken English, but is still considered a fault when one is trying to be precise (as I want you to be).
#### hyphenating phrasal adjectives
Phrasal adjectives (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

#### *impactful*
As usage expert Paul Brians argues, "Many people in business and education like to speak of things that have an impact as being 'impactful,' but this term does not appear in most dictionaries and is not well thought of by traditionalists. Use 'influential' or 'effective' instead." *Impactful* may be in dictionaries by now, but some usage experts (and I) consider it yet another awful corporate buzzword (e.g., *Let's reach out for some impactful metrics in our mobile, disruptive, next-gen solutions brainstorming.*). Take Brians' suggestions re: *influential* or *effective.*
#### *In conclusion*, *In summary*
**Never** end a paper or other project with *In conclusion* or *In summary* because you'll sound like a fifth-grader writing a book report. Harvard's Writing Center has some [good advice](http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions), as does the [Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/conclusions/).
#### *incredible,* *incredibly*
For some reason, students seem to love to write *incredible* and *incredibly.* I had a paper recently that had seven instances of *incredibly* in four pages. These words are hyperbolic, imprecise, and should usually be replaced. Much like the overused word *very,* *incredibly* usually signals a phrase that can be cut and then replaced by a single well-chosen adjective. 
#### indirect quote
An "indirect quote" is a source quoted in another source. For example, suppose Source A quotes and cites Source B, but you don't have Source B yourself. In MLA style use *qtd. in* to indicate the source you actually used. For example: Sherman contends that "Writing centers across the country have struggled with the problem of securing adequate resources" (qtd. in Jefferson 493). That construction signals that you are using the quotation and citation to Sherman from p. 493 of Jefferson, but you are not using the original Sherman source itself. NB: Except for use of textbook-type materials, a good researcher will try to find the original source, rather than relying on indirect quotes. In any case, you have to accurately attribute quotes to their actual sources. 
#### *infamous*
Be sure that you really mean *infamous,* which has negative connotations. Often, students write *infamous* when they mean *famous*. Merriam-Webster Dictionaries [explains the two words' meaning](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/infamous-vs-famous).
#### *in order to*, *in order for*
*In order to* and *in order for* can usually be cut to *to* or *for* without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
#### in-text citations and closing punctuation--MLA and APA format
The in-text citation is part of the sentence, so the closing punctuation (typically a period) of your sentence containing the citation goes **after** the closing parenthesis of the citation. So, like this (MLA example): Smith argues that "if students can be taught to develop a set of help-seeking behaviors, their peformance in writing courses "can exceed all predicted outcomes" (65). <---See that period after the closing parenthesis?
#### in-text citations and shortening titles (MLA)
It's tedious and unnecessary to keep repeating a long title of a source in an in-text citation. [Writing Commons offers this advice](https://writingcommons.org/open-text/collaboration/167-common-comments/in-text-citations-/625-abbreviate-the-title-of-this-source-in-the-citation) on shortening titles meaningfully.
#### *issue* vs. *problem*
If you mean *problem*, you should just write *problem*. Many people use *issue* as a synonym, but it's imprecise. Rework.  
#### *its* vs. *it's*: 
*Its* is the possessive of *it*: *The monkey played with its tail*. *It's* is a contraction for *it is*: *It's important to know how to cook.*

# J
#### *judgment* vs. *judgement*
In American spelling, it's *judgment.* 

# L 

#### *less* vs. *fewer*
See [this advice from Bryan Garner:](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-144-less-vs-fewer/]) "Use *fewer* when referring to individual or countable things (*fewer than ten chairs*, *fewer questions asked by judges*). Use *less* when referring to volume, quantity, or degree (*less influence on the jurors*), mass or bulk nouns (*less water in the glass*), or units of measure or time (*less than three ounces,* *less than five months*). There is one exception: use *less* when count nouns are really being used as amounts instead of individual increments (he has *less* than one million dollars*, *We have less than two minutes of rebuttal time*)."
#### *lie* and *lay*
Errors with these irregular verbs are common. [Here is some solid advice](http://web.ku.edu/~edit/lie.html) and a way to double-check your usage. 
#### *like* vs. *such as*
Strict usage sticklers insist that *like* (in this sense) means "similar to," while *such as* introduces examples. This so-called rule may never have been a rule in the first place, but some readers insist upon it. In general, it might be a good idea to ask whether you mean to focus on the class of things (drawing similarities) or on examples and choose accordingly. I have read that academic writing favors *such as* because it often uses examples, but I have not seen the support for that position myself. A [history and synopsis of this usage question](http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/02/like-such-as.html) can be found at the Grammarphobia blog. 
#### *Look at/looking at*/*talk about*
These phrases as synonyms for *analyze* or *examine* are okay in informal speech and informal writing, but you're probably better off being precise and just writing *analyze,* *examine,* or some such in most of your expository writing.

# M
#### *Meaning that*
If you begin a sentence *Meaning that....*, you are probably trying to express something like *In other words,...* *Meaning that....* usually indicates a sentence fragment.
#### *medium/media*
*Media* as a mass noun is perfectly okay: *The media are investigating Anthony Weiner's tweets.* When referring to a single medium, such as TV, radio, etc., use *medium.* When referring to more than one medium, use *media,* never *mediums*: *Shep Gordon has promoted a variety of artists in several media: live performance, television, films, and books.* *Mediums* is the plural of *medium,* i.e., a person who claims to be in contact with the spirit world: *Madame Xsaya is a medium who charges $500 for a seance* or sizes of things: *Old Navy was sold out of large T-shirts--I could only find mediums.* 

# N
#### names
When referring to someone by name, use first name and last name the first time you mention them (*Kenneth Burke*), then last name from that point forward (*Later, Burke adds that....*). You don't need to keep repeating their first and last names together. If you have two people with the same last name, you'll have to bend this rule so as to keep clear who you mean. 

Watch out when you use first names--generally, most analytical or expository writing uses last names. Using someone's first name often creates a tone problem, a problem that is magnified if you refer to men as *Mr. So and So*, but revert to first names when referring to women (odd tone becomes sexist tone).

# O
#### *obviously*
This word can usually be cut. It adds little to something that you have shown already (if you have shown it clearly, there is no need to lard it up with *obviously*). 
#### *OK*
In class projects, it's *OK* or *okay,* (or even *O.K.,* but this is relatively uncommon). It is never *ok* (unless maybe you are quoting a text message or someething). *OK* is always casual, so consider whether you should replace it in precise writing occasions. 
#### *only* misplaced
Bryan Garner argues that "The word *only* is probably misplaced more often than any other modifier," and Mignon Fogarty calls *only* "the most insidious misplaced modifier." Where *only* goes can radically alter the meaning of the sentence. See [the five examples here](http://www.shearsoneditorial.com/2012/02/adverb-placement-predominantly-mainly-mostly/). See also [Garner's advice](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-129-placement-of-only/). Read your writing aloud and ask yourself where the *only* should be placed to emphasize what you really meant to emphasize.

# P

#### Paramedic Method
Richard Lanham's famous Paramedic Method for revising sentences helps you to rework vague, wordy, bureaucratic-sounding prose. [The Purdue OWL explains this easy, effective method](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/635/01/) for tightening sentences and reworking wooly ideas. The Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has [an excellent handout](http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_wordyphrases.html) on tightening wordy phrases.
#### passive voice
You should have a strong bias favoring active voice (*Lincoln delivered the speech*) over passive voice (*The speech was delivered by Lincoln*), unless you have a specific reason for using passive voice. Passive voice is not **wrong**; it’s just (usually) weaker. For more details, see [this handout from our Writing Center](https://sites.stedwards.edu/writing/files/2015/09/St.-Edwards-Univ-Writing-Center-Handout-on-Passive-Voice-19nzb1n.pdf). 
#### *per,* *as per,* *as per usual/per usual*
I agree with Bryan Garner that *per* is an avoidable Latinism that should simply be replaced with *under*, *according to,* or the like. *As per* is doubly clunky since it is both a Latinism and redundant bit of bizspeak, giving the reader nothing more than the already-clunky *per* gives. Finally, as Garner argues (and I agree), the phrase *as per usual/per usual* is "an embarassing barbarism" that one should never write. 
#### people vs entities: pronouns
Is it *it/its* or *they/theirs* when referring to groups of people, companies, countries? See [this advice](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/people-versus-entities).
#### *principal* vs *principle*
Writers often confuse these two words. They have nothing to do with each other, though they sound alike. Bryan Garner explains that *principle* is most commonly a noun (e.g., *the principle of charity,* *the Peter principle*), but *principal* can be an adjective meaning "first or most important" (*the principal reason she lost the case*) or a noun (e.g., *the school principal*). 
#### *problematic*
*Problematic* is often used to flag a statement, an idea, or a representation as wrong, pernicious, or troubling in some way, at least from the perspective of the person labeling it *problematic.* There's nothing inherently wrong with *problematic,* except it has been used so often and in so many contexts (ranging from the truly troubling to the mildly annoying or even frivolous) that it is in danger of devolving into a mere cliche. Bryan Garner has no problem with it, calling it "standard" usage (Source: *Garner's Modern English Usage*, 4th ed.). But it has become so common and so readily deployed that--at least in my opinion--it is in danger of becoming a placeholder for an argument rather than a precise term that enables argument. So: use with caution and consider rewording for precision. 

# Q

#### quotation marks, single vs. double
In American usage, double quotation marks start a quotation and single quotation marks are for material quoted inside that quote: *Jones agrees with this point, adding that "Whenever he had a few too many Red Bulls, I often heard Dr. Doom claim that he was 'sure to vanquish that pesky Spider-Man'" (67).* Use double quotations for those ironic, sarcastic quotation marks that distance you from the term or material within the quotation marks: *This "innovation" that the consultant touted is not worth the effort.* These are sometimes called *shudder quotes* and have the effect of adding "so-called": *This [so-called] "innovation."* Use shudder quotes sparingly--a writer who leans too heavily on them comes off as snarky, hectoring, or tedious. 
#### quotation marks with other punctuation 
See [this resource on punctuation and quotation marks](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/01/) by the Purdue OWL. Students often mistakenly place periods and commas outside of quotation marks when they should be inside (in US usage; in the UK and other countries, different conventions apply).

# R

#### *reach out to*
*Reach out to* is voguish bizspeak for *contact, call, write*, or some other specific verb. *Reach out to* is becoming common usage, but many readers find it grating, vague, and wordy. A specific single verb is probably best.
#### *reason[s] as to why*
This phrase expresses nothing more than writing *reason[s] why*; *as to* should be cut in all cases. Try also to cut *why* and see if the sentence can be improved. *Reason[s] why* is mildly redundant, but (according to Garner), well-established and accepted. 
#### *relatable*
*Relatable* is a vague word that many readers, including me, dislike. When students use *relatable*, they usually mean to express something about identification, empathy, or appealing to an audience. Can you reword to be clearer? 
####  *relate to*
That X "relates to" Y explains almost nothing. Here is an exaggerated illustration: I "relate to" the planet Neptune because we are in the same solar system. So what? Can you reword to be clearer? What is the exact relationship between X and Y?
#### *reveal* as noun
This reality-show buzzword is becoming more and more common in everyday parlance, but it often causes a weird tone in academic or professional writing, making it borrow a hackneyed TV trope ("the big reveal"). In writing, stick to using *reveal* just as a verb and find some other way to express the thought. 

# S

#### *said* [for *this,* *those,* or *that*]
If you mean *that* or *those*, write *that* or *those.* *Said* sounds like a legalese-loving attorney, not like a human being communicating something interesting.
#### semicolons in series
If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. 
#### serial comma aka "Oxford comma"
I favor the serial comma (aka “Oxford comma") because it enhances clarity. [Definition and examples](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma)
#### sexist language
[Garner offers strategies](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-3/) for reworking sentences to avoid a generic masculine pronoun and for [handling words that traditionally end in -man](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-5/) (e.g., *fireman* becomes *firefighter*). 
#### *showcase*
If you mean *show* or *demonstrate* or *establish,* you should just write those words. *Showcase* has become (to my mind, anyway), an overused and hyperbolic-sounding buzzword. 
#### [*sic*]
When a source truly misspells something or is ungrammatical, but you are quoting it exactly anyway for some good reason, use [*sic*] so readers know that the fault is not yours. [Bryan Garner offers more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sic/), including advice about when not to use [*sic*]. Another option is to alter the quote responsibly to fix the error. See the [Purdue OWL's advice on altering source material in a quotation](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/02/).
#### *significant*
*Significant* has become a fraught word because of abuses and misunderstandings of the concept of **statistical significance**, which [Diane F. Halpern explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11693), [Charles Seife explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25414), and from confusions about the related concept of effect size, which [Bruce Hood explains here](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25414). Be sure to understand how any of your sources is using (or abusing) *significance* in the scientific sense, and consider alternative adjectives in your own writing. 


# T

#### *that* vs. *which*
In American usage, favor *that* over  *which,* unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use *which* plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use *that* to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky.* EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: *Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip."* Bryan Garner offers [more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-that-1/).
#### *that*, wrongly suppressed
Bryan Garner: "In formal writing *that* is often ill-advisedly omitted, creating a miscue or an ambiguity, even if only momentarily. In particular, the conjunction that should usually be retained to introduce clauses following verbs such as *acknowledge, ask, believe, claim, doubt, hold, indicate, say*, and *suggest*. [More here on the "wrongly suppressed *that*](http://abovethelaw.com/career-files/lawprose-lesson-127-wrongly-suppressed-that/).
#### *they,* singular 
[Bryan Garner has covered this masterfully](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-sexism-4/). I accept the singular *they* because it has a long history of use, it solves the English language's common-sex singular personal pronoun glitch, and it avoids sexism. The singular *they* can also be used to refer to people who don't identify as male or female. Much more on that [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34901704). Avoid convoluted constructions such as *his/her* and the like. Sentences can often be reworked to avoid the pronoun, too.
#### titles, articles in periodicals, chapters in edited collections of scholary essays
Titles of articles in periodicals (newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals) and chapters in edited collections of scholarly essays should be in quotation marks, in title case, no italics, no bolding: Lucas, Brad E. and Drew M. Loewe. “Coordinating Citations and the Cartography of Knowledge: Finding True North in Five Scholarly Journals.” *The Changing of Knowledge in Composition: Contemporary Perspectives*, edited by Richard Gebhardt and Lance Massey, Utah State UP, 2011, pp. 264-82.
#### titles, blog posts or single pages from a website
Use quotation marks. Examples: "Decrying Dialects and Despising Speakers,"About Us,""Our Mission," "Something is Wrong on the Internet."
#### titles, books
Italicize book titles. No quotation marks. Ex.: *A Rhetoric of Motives*, *The Hobbit*, *Rhetoric Retold: Regendering the Tradition from Antiquity Through the Renaissance*.
#### titles, films
In MLA style, film titles are italicized: *The Godfather*, *Shrek*, *Sharknado*. Other styles, such as the *New York Times* style sheet, use double quotation marks: "The Godfather," "Shrek," "Sharknado."
#### titles, music
In MLA style, song titles are set off with quotation marks: "Welcome to the Terrordome," "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Album titles are italicized: *Houses of the Holy,* *Q: Are We Not Men? A: We are Devo!*
#### titles, periodicals
Titles of periodicals (newspapers, magazines, scholarly journals) should be italicized: *New York Times,* the *Times* article, *Rhetoric Review,* *National Geographic,* *Lucky Peach.* 
#### titles, plays
In MLA style, play titles are italicized: *The Book of Mormon,* *Hamlet,* *Glengarry Glen Ross.* The titles of short plays, e.g., one-act plays, are in quotation marks: "This Is a Test," "Two Guys in a Bar." Individual numbers (songs) in a musical are titled in quotation marks: "Man Up," "Aaron Burr, Sir." 
#### titles, TV shows
In MLA style, italicize the titles of TV programs: *The Wire,* *Monday Night Football*. Use quotation marks for titles of individual episodes: The “Amok Time” episode of *Star Trek*
#### *try and*
*Try and* should probably be *try to*. While *try and* is an accepted informal and (especially) spoken form of expressing *try to,* you can never go wrong by writing *try to.* Oddly, *try and* is standard in UK usage, according to Garner. But in US academic or legal contexts, stick to *try to.* 

# U
#### *use* vs *utilize*
Some people [claim that there is a meaningful distinction between these words](http://throwgrammarfromthetrain.blogspot.com/2013/12/using-utilize-what-mavens-say.html), but I am not convinced. In my view, *utilize* is always inferior to *use* because it is bureucratic-sounding, elliptical, and unnecessarily burdensome.

# V

#### verbs, precise
Forms of: *says, writes, states, thinks*, and *feels* are usually less vivid or precise than other verbs you can choose. Try to choose a verb that most accurately characterizes the action you are trying to show. Here is a [list of precise verbs](https://studentsuccess.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Annotation%20Verbs.pdf) that you will find useful in replacing weak verbs.
#### *very*
*Very* should often be cut. It is usually a filler word. *Very* followed by an adjective usually signals a weak construction that should be tightened by cutting *very* and choosing a precise adjective. Examples: *very smart* (try *brilliant)*, *very important* (try *essential*), or *very old* (try *ancient*). 
#### *very unique*
*Very unique* is a phrase that should be used with caution in edited writing. [The folks at Merriam-Webster explain why](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/very-unique-and-absolute-adjectives) (scroll to bottom of page).

# W
#### *whether or not*
Bryan Garner reminds us that "Despite the superstition to the contrary, the words *or not* are usually superfluous, sinces *whether* implies *or not.*" But, he adds, "*or not* is necessary when *whether or not* means 'regarless of whether' [e.g.,] *the meeting will go on whether or not it rains*." More than half of the student uses of *whether* that I've seen are of the first kind, making *or not* superfluous. 
#### *who, whom*
[Bryan Garner offers some excellent advice.](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-176-who-vs-whom/)
#### *who vs. that* 
The [Purdue OWL summarizes the current thinking on *who* vs. *that*](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/645/01/): "When referring to people, both *that* and *who* can be used in informal language. *That* may be used to refer to the characteristics or abilities of an individual or a group of people: *He is the kind of person that/who will never let you down.*[...] However, when speaking about a particular person in formal language, *who* is preferred: *The old lady who lives next door is a teacher.*" In my opinion, using *who* for people preserves something special about being a person, if indeed there is something special about being a person--certainly, many people still think so. *That* sounds a bit like you're referring to an object, so it's frowned upon slightly in some quarters. Technically, though, *that* is correct and has a long history of usage. 
#### *would be* as odd substitute for *is/was/were*
Writers often use *would be* as an odd substitute for forms of the verb *to be.* Compare: *The best golfer on the tour would be Jordan Spieth.* Unless you are expressing something about the future, you don't need *would be* when you could just write *is* or *was*: *The best golfer on the tour is Jordan Spieth.*
