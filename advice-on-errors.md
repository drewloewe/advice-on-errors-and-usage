# A

+ [apostrophe error](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/)
+ 

# B
+ being that: Never write "being that" to mean "because." Just write "because."
+ Britishisms: Avoid Britishisms (e.g., colour, humour, whilst, spelt, spot-on) in American contexts. 

# C

+ comma splice: If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences.You have several options to rework a comma splice. See (this advice from a textbook)[http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/everyday_writer3e/20errors/8.html] for help. 

# D

+ decades: Do not use apostrophe before the s in a decade. Incorrect: 1970's; *Correct: 1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *The '60s*

# E
# F

+ fragment (sentence fragment). Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. Like this. Really. 
Most of the time, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some (great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments)[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/]. 

# G

+ GSA=Giant Squishy Abstraction. GSAs (e.g.,  "technology," "human nature," "society," etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

+ hyphenating phrasal adjectives: Phrasal adjective (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is pplicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# S

+ semicolons in series: If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. However, here no list item has its own comma, so don't use semicolons to separate them. Use commas instead.
