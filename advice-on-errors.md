# A

+ [apostrophe error](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/)
+ 

# B
+ ###being that: Never write "being that" to mean "because." Just write "because."
+ ###Britishisms: Avoid Britishisms (e.g., colour, humour, whilst, spelt, spot-on) in American contexts. 
+ ###buried verb: A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a –tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance, or –ity ending added to the verb (e.g., realization instead of realize). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

+ comma after introductory element: Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: **Before I could kill Count Dracula,** I had to find a wooden stake. Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. (The Purdue OWL explains more here)[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/03/].
+ comma splice: If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences.You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from a textbook](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/everyday_writer3e/20errors/8.html) for help. 

# D

+ decades: Do not use apostrophe before the s in a decade. Incorrect: 1970's; *Correct: 1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *The '60s*
+ dropped quote: Always integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. A “dropped quote” is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** The quote is simply plunked into the writing. 

Possible fix: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in as if it stops the conversation of your paper. 


# E
# F

+ fragment (sentence fragment). Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. Like this. Really. 
Most of the time, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/). 
+ fused (aka run-on) sentence: If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. [Advice from the Center for Writing Studies, UIUC](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/fusedsentences/).


# G

+ GSA=Giant Squishy Abstraction. GSAs (e.g.,  "technology," "human nature," "society," etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

+ hyphenating phrasal adjectives: Phrasal adjective (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

+ in order to/in order for: "In order to"/"in order for" can usually be cut to "to"/"for" without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
+ its/it's: *Its* is the possessive of it: The monkey played with its tail. *It's* is a contraction for "it is": It's important to know how to cook.

# L 
+ Look at/looking at: These are vague phrases. If you mean something like "analyze" or "examine," use forms of those verbs.

# S

+ semicolons in series: If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. However, here no list item has its own comma, so don't use semicolons to separate them. Use commas instead. 

# T

+ that vs. which: In American usage, favor "that" over  "which," unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use “which” plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use “that” to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky. EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip."
