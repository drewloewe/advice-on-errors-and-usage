# A

#### apostrophe error
The Purdue OWL [has some great advice on using apostrophes](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/)


# B
#### begs the question vs. raises the question
Begging the question is a logical fallacy of circular argument, e.g., "God created the world because the Bible says so." Using "beg the question" to mean "raise the question" is certain to annoy traditionalists (on this, I am a traditionalist) because they see it as imprecise. 

#### being that
Never write "being that" to mean "because." Just write "because."
#### Britishisms
Avoid Britishisms (e.g., colour, humour, whilst, spelt, spot-on) in American contexts. 
#### buried verb
A “buried” verb is a noun that is really a verb or adjective in disguise, often with a –tion, -sion, -ment, -ence, -ance, or –ity ending added to the verb (e.g., realization instead of realize). Vigorous, clear writing favors simple “unburied” prose. See [this column](http://www.latimes.com/tn-gnp-0612-casagrande-story.html) for more advice.

# C

#### comma after introductory element
Introductory elements are dependent clauses that set up, contextualize, or introduce the main subject-verb part of a sentence (i.e., the independent clause). Example: **Before I could kill Count Dracula,** I had to find a wooden stake. Introductory elements often (but not always) require a comma. (The Purdue OWL explains more here)[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/03/].
#### comma splice
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are joined with a comma, you have a comma splice. Comma splices are disruptive errors because a comma is “too weak” (too short a pause) to join sentences.You have several options to rework a comma splice. See [this advice from a textbook](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/everyday_writer3e/20errors/8.html) for help. 

# D

#### decades
Do not use apostrophe before the s in a decade. Incorrect: 1970's; *Correct: 1970s.* However, you do use an apostrophe to signal omission of the first part of a decade: *The '60s*
#### dropped quote
Always integrate quoted material into a sentence of your own writing. If you don’t, the quote feels “dropped” or plunked into the paper, harming both your voice and your control of source material. A “dropped quote” is a quote that you do not set up, introduce, or explain with your own writing. 

Example of dropped quote: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. **“The challenge we face as teachers is to develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise; it is a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new, that our students have not learned” (156).** The quote is simply plunked into the writing. 

Possible fix: Harvard writing teacher Nancy Sommers argues that teachers should work on giving students feedback that motivates revision. She calls on teachers to **“develop comments which will provide an inherent reason for students to revise”** because students don’t yet have **“a sense of revision as discovery, as a repeated process of beginning again, as starting out new” (156)**. What are all the changes you see between the two versions of the Sommers quote? 

**NB**: After the quote, you should use it in some way: connect it to other source material, comment on it, argue with it, etc. Even if you integrate sources correctly and avoid dropped quotes, you still have to work with the source, not just plop it in as if it stops the conversation of your paper. 


# E
# F

#### female as noun
If you mean a human being, use "girl" or "woman"--whichever is age-appropriate. Only when writing scientifically or about animals should you use female as a noun, e.g., "These lab rats are the males; these are the females." 
#### fragment (sentence fragment)
Sometimes, expert writers use sentence fragments for voice or rhetorical flourish. Like this. Really. Usually, though, and especially in more formal genres, students are better off making sure that each of their sentences is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. In many cases, sentence fragments in student writing are disruptive errors. The Purdue OWL has some [great advice on finding and fixing sentence fragments](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/01/). 
#### fused (aka run-on) sentence
If you have two clauses that could each stand alone as individual sentences but they are “smushed” together without punctuation or words to link them, you have a run-on sentence. The run-on sentence is a major disruptive sentence error that harms a writer's credibility--perhaps more than any other disruptive sentence error. [Advice from the Center for Writing Studies, UIUC](http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/fusedsentences/).


# G

#### GSA=Giant Squishy Abstraction
GSAs (e.g.,  "technology," "human nature," "society," etc.) are enemies of precision and clarity. They are huge abstract concepts that are, necessarily, almost impossible to wrestle with in most of your projects. How might you refine, clarify, and refocus?

# H

#### hyphenating phrasal adjectives
Phrasal adjective (phrases being used as adjectives) should generally be hyphenated, e.g., last-known address. [Bryan Garner explains more, with examples](http://www.lawprose.org/lawprose-lesson-151-the-art-of-hyphenating-phrasal-adjectives). That post is written for lawyers, but is applicable to any expository writer. **It also lists the exceptions to the general rule.**

# I

#### impactful
As usage expert Paul Brians argues, "Many people in business and education like to speak of things that have an impact as being 'impactful,' but this term does not appear in most dictionaries and is not well thought of by traditionalists. Use 'influential' or 'effective' instead." "Impactful" may be in dictionaries by now, but some usage experts (and I) consider it yet another imprecise corporate buzzword (e.g., "Let's reach out for some impactful metrics in our mobile, disruptive, next-gen solutions brainstorming"). Take Brians' suggestions re: "influential" or "effective." 
#### incredibly
Students love to write "incredibly" for some reason--I had a paper recently that had 7 "incrediblys" in 4 pages. It's an adverb that is imprecise and should usually be changed or cut. It's usually a sign of a phrase that can be replaced by a well-chosen adjective. 
#### indirect quote
An "indirect quote" is a source quoted in another source. For example, suppose Source A quotes and cites Source B, but you don't have Source B yourself. For such indirect quotations, use "qtd. in" to indicate the source you actually used. For example: Sherman contends that "Writing centers across the country have struggled with the problem of securing adequate resources" (qtd. in Jefferson 493). 
That signals that you are using the quotation and citation to Sherman from p. 493 of Jefferson, but you are not using the original Sherman source itself. NB: Except for use of textbook-type materials, a good researcher will try to find the original source, rather than relying on indirect quotes. In any case, you have to accurately attribute quotes to their actual sources. 
#### in order to/in order for
"In order to"/"in order for" can usually be cut to "to"/"for" without losing meaning. Try cutting and see whether you think it works.
#### issue vs. problem
If you mean "problem," you should just write "problem." Many people use "issue" as a synonym for "problem," but it's imprecise. Can you rework this?  
#### its/it's: 
*Its* is the possessive of it: The monkey played with its tail. *It's* is a contraction for "it is": It's important to know how to cook.

# L 
#### Look at/looking at
These are vague phrases. If you mean something like "analyze" or "examine," use forms of those verbs.

# R
#### relatable
"Relatable" is a vague word that many professors, including me, dislike. When students use "relatable," they usually mean to express something like identification, empathy, or appealing to an audience. Can you reword to be clearer?

# S

#### semicolons in series
If even one of the individual items in a list has a comma, separate all list items with semicolons. However, here no list item has its own comma, so don't use semicolons to separate them. Use commas instead. 
#### serial comma aka "Oxford comma"
I favor the serial comma (aka “Oxford comma") because it enhances clarity. [Definition and examples](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma)

# T

#### that vs. which
In American usage, favor "that" over  "which," unless you have a nonrestrictive [i.e., not necessary to the sentence] clause. The basic rule: Use “which” plus commas to  set off nonrestrictive (unnecessary) clauses; use “that” to introduce a restrictive (necessary) clause. EXAMPLE OF NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip, which is a favorite among Austinites, can be either smooth or chunky. EXAMPLE OF RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Queso dip that contains too much Velveeta is called "fake queso dip." Bryan Garner offers [more advice](http://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-that-1/).
#### TV titles
Italicize the titles of TV programs: *The Wire,* *Monday Night Football*. Use quotation marks for titles of individual episodes: The “Amok Time” episode of *Star Trek*
